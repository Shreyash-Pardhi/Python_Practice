of paint and shiny beads done for art class. Without knowing the size of the object in units we all recognize, such as meters or
inches, it is difficult to know what we’re looking at. In fact, this image shows the Whirlpool Galaxy (and its companion galaxy),
which is about 60,000 light-years in diameter (about 6 × 1017 km across). (credit: modification of work by S. Beckwith

Introduction
As noted in the figure caption, the chapter-opening image is of the Whirlpool Galaxy, which we examine in the first section
of this chapter. Galaxies are as immense as atoms are small, yet the same laws of physics describe both, along with all the
rest of nature—an indication of the underlying unity in the universe. The laws of physics are surprisingly few, implying an
underlying simplicity to nature’s apparent complexity. In this text, you learn about the laws of physics. Galaxies and atoms
may seem far removed from your daily life, but as you begin to explore this broad-ranging subject, you may soon come to

realize that physics plays a much larger role in your life than you first thought, no matter your life goals or career choice.
1.1 | The Scope and Scale of Physics
Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Describe the scope of physics.
•
Calculate the order of magnitude of a quantity.
•
Compare measurable length, mass, and timescales quantitatively.
•
Describe the relationships among models, theories, and laws.
Physics is devoted to the understanding of all natural phenomena. In physics, we try to understand physical phenomena at all
scales—from the world of subatomic particles to the entire universe. Despite the breadth of the subject, the various subfields
of physics share a common core. The same basic training in physics will prepare you to work in any area of physics and the
related areas of science and engineering. In this section, we investigate the scope of physics; the scales of length, mass, and
time over which the laws of physics have been shown to be applicable; and the process by which science in general, and
physics in particular, operates.
The Scope of Physics
Take another look at the chapter-opening image. The Whirlpool Galaxy contains billions of individual stars as well as huge
clouds of gas and dust. Its companion galaxy is also visible to the right. This pair of galaxies lies a staggering billion
trillion miles (1.4 × 1021 mi) from our own galaxy (which is called the Milky Way). The stars and planets that make up
the Whirlpool Galaxy might seem to be the furthest thing from most people’s everyday lives, but the Whirlpool is a great
starting point to think about the forces that hold the universe together. The forces that cause the Whirlpool Galaxy to act as
it does are thought to be the same forces we contend with here on Earth, whether we are planning to send a rocket into space
or simply planning to raise the walls for a new home. The gravity that causes the stars of the Whirlpool Galaxy to rotate and
revolve is thought to be the same as what causes water to flow over hydroelectric dams here on Earth. When you look up
at the stars, realize the forces out there are the same as the ones here on Earth. Through a study of physics, you may gain a
greater understanding of the interconnectedness of everything we can see and know in this universe.
Think, now, about all the technological devices you use on a regular basis. Computers, smartphones, global positioning
systems (GPSs), MP3 players, and satellite radio might come to mind. Then, think about the most exciting modern
technologies you have heard about in the news, such as trains that levitate above tracks, “invisibility cloaks” that bend light
around them, and microscopic robots that fight cancer cells in our bodies. All these groundbreaking advances, commonplace
or unbelievable, rely on the principles of physics. Aside from playing a significant role in technology, professionals such
as engineers, pilots, physicians, physical therapists, electricians, and computer programmers apply physics concepts in their
daily work. For example, a pilot must understand how wind forces affect a flight path; a physical therapist must understand
how the muscles in the body experience forces as they move and bend. As you will learn in this text, the principles of
physics are propelling new, exciting technologies, and these principles are applied in a wide range of careers.
The underlying order of nature makes science in general, and physics in particular, interesting and enjoyable to study. For
example, what do a bag of chips and a car battery have in common? Both contain energy that can be converted to other
forms. The law of conservation of energy (which says that energy can change form but is never lost) ties together such
topics as food calories, batteries, heat, light, and watch springs. Understanding this law makes it easier to learn about the
various forms energy takes and how they relate to one another. Apparently unrelated topics are connected through broadly
applicable physical laws, permitting an understanding beyond just the memorization of lists of facts.
Science consists of theories and laws that are the general truths of nature, as well as the body of knowledge they encompass.
Scientists are continuously trying to expand this body of knowledge and to perfect the expression of the laws that describe
it. Physics, which comes from the Greek phúsis, meaning “nature,” is concerned with describing the interactions of
energy, matter, space, and time to uncover the fundamental mechanisms that underlie every phenomenon. This concern for
describing the basic phenomena in nature essentially defines the scope of physics.
Physics aims to understand the world around us at the most basic level. It emphasizes the use of a small number of
quantitative laws to do this, which can be useful to other fields pushing the performance boundaries of existing technologies.
Consider a smartphone (Figure 1.2). Physics describes how electricity interacts with the various circuits inside the device.

of the physics underlying these devices is required to shrink their size or increase their processing speed. Or, think about a
GPS. Physics describes the relationship between the speed of an object, the distance over which it travels, and the time it
takes to travel that distance. When you use a GPS in a vehicle, it relies on physics equations to determine the travel time
from one location to another.
Figure 1.2 The Apple iPhone is a common smartphone with a
GPS function. Physics describes the way that electricity flows
through the circuits of this device. Engineers use their
knowledge of physics to construct an iPhone with features that
consumers will enjoy. One specific feature of an iPhone is the
GPS function. A GPS uses physics equations to determine the
drive time between two locations on a map. (credit: Jane

Knowledge of physics is useful in everyday situations as well as in nonscientific professions. It can help you understand
how microwave ovens work, why metals should not be put into them, and why they might affect pacemakers. Physics allows
you to understand the hazards of radiation and to evaluate these hazards rationally and more easily. Physics also explains the
reason why a black car radiator helps remove heat in a car engine, and it explains why a white roof helps keep the inside of
a house cool. Similarly, the operation of a car’s ignition system as well as the transmission of electrical signals throughout
our body’s nervous system are much easier to understand when you think about them in terms of basic physics.
Physics is a key element of many important disciplines and contributes directly to others. Chemistry, for example—since
it deals with the interactions of atoms and molecules—has close ties to atomic and molecular physics. Most branches of
engineering are concerned with designing new technologies, processes, or structures within the constraints set by the laws
of physics. In architecture, physics is at the heart of structural stability and is involved in the acoustics, heating, lighting, and
cooling of buildings. Parts of geology rely heavily on physics, such as radioactive dating of rocks, earthquake analysis, and
heat transfer within Earth. Some disciplines, such as biophysics and geophysics, are hybrids of physics and other disciplines.
Physics has many applications in the biological sciences. On the microscopic level, it helps describe the properties of
cells and their environments. On the macroscopic level, it explains the heat, work, and power associated with the human
body and its various organ systems. Physics is involved in medical diagnostics, such as radiographs, magnetic resonance
imaging, and ultrasonic blood flow measurements. Medical therapy sometimes involves physics directly; for example,
cancer radiotherapy uses ionizing radiation. Physics also explains sensory phenomena, such as how musical instruments
make sound, how the eye detects color, and how lasers transmit information.
It is not necessary to study all applications of physics formally. What is most useful is knowing the basic laws of physics
and developing skills in the analytical methods for applying them. The study of physics also can improve your problem-
solving skills. Furthermore, physics retains the most basic aspects of science, so it is used by all the sciences, and the study
of physics makes other sciences easier to understand.

The Scale of Physics
From the discussion so far, it should be clear that to accomplish your goals in any of the various fields within the natural
sciences and engineering, a thorough grounding in the laws of physics is necessary. The reason for this is simply that the
laws of physics govern everything in the observable universe at all measurable scales of length, mass, and time. Now, that
is easy enough to say, but to come to grips with what it really means, we need to get a little bit quantitative. So, before
surveying the various scales that physics allows us to explore, let’s first look at the concept of “order of magnitude,” which
we use to come to terms with the vast ranges of length, mass, and time that we consider in this text (Figure 1.3).
Figure 1.3 (a) Using a scanning tunneling microscope, scientists can see the individual atoms (diameters around 10–10 m) that
compose this sheet of gold. (b) Tiny phytoplankton swim among crystals of ice in the Antarctic Sea. They range from a few
micrometers (1 μm is 10–6 m) to as much as 2 mm (1 mm is 10–3 m) in length. (c) These two colliding galaxies, known as NGC
4676A (right) and NGC 4676B (left), are nicknamed “The Mice” because of the tail of gas emanating from each one. They are
located 300 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Coma Berenices. Eventually, these two galaxies will merge into
one. (credit a: modification of work by ""Erwinrossen""/Wikimedia Commons; credit b: modification of work by Prof. Gordon T.

Order of magnitude
The order of magnitude of a number is the power of 10 that most closely approximates it. Thus, the order of magnitude
refers to the scale (or size) of a value. Each power of 10 represents a different order of magnitude. For example,
101, 102, 103,
and so forth, are all different orders of magnitude, as are 100 = 1, 10−1, 10−2,
and 10−3. To find the
order of magnitude of a number, take the base-10 logarithm of the number and round it to the nearest integer, then the order
of magnitude of the number is simply the resulting power of 10. For example, the order of magnitude of 800 is 103 because
log10 800 ≈2.903,
which rounds to 3. Similarly, the order of magnitude of 450 is 103 because log10 450 ≈2.653,
which rounds to 3 as well. Thus, we say the numbers 800 and 450 are of the same order of magnitude: 103. However, the
order of magnitude of 250 is 102 because log10 250 ≈2.397,
which rounds to 2.
An equivalent but quicker way to find the order of magnitude of a number is first to write it in scientific notation and then
check to see whether the first factor is greater than or less than
10 = 100.5 ≈3. The idea is that
10 = 100.5 is halfway
between 1 = 100 and 10 = 101 on a log base-10 scale. Thus, if the first factor is less than
10,
then we round it down
to 1 and the order of magnitude is simply whatever power of 10 is required to write the number in scientific notation. On
the other hand, if the first factor is greater than
10,
then we round it up to 10 and the order of magnitude is one power of
10 higher than the power needed to write the number in scientific notation. For example, the number 800 can be written in
scientific notation as 8 × 102. Because 8 is bigger than
10 ≈3, we say the order of magnitude of 800 is 102 + 1 = 103.
The number 450 can be written as 4.5 × 102,
so its order of magnitude is also 103 because 4.5 is greater than 3. However,
250 written in scientific notation is 2.5 × 102 and 2.5 is less than 3, so its order of magnitude is 102.
The order of magnitude of a number is designed to be a ballpark estimate for the scale (or size) of its value. It is simply a
way of rounding numbers consistently to the nearest power of 10. This makes doing rough mental math with very big and
very small numbers easier. For example, the diameter of a hydrogen atom is on the order of 10−10 m, whereas the diameter
of the Sun is on the order of 109 m, so it would take roughly 109 /10−10 = 1019 hydrogen atoms to stretch across the
10

diameter of the Sun. This is much easier to do in your head than using the more precise values of 1.06 × 10−10m for a
hydrogen atom diameter and 1.39 × 109 m for the Sun’s diameter, to find that it would take 1.31 × 1019 hydrogen atoms
to stretch across the Sun’s diameter. In addition to being easier, the rough estimate is also nearly as informative as the precise
calculation.
Known ranges of length, mass, and time
The vastness of the universe and the breadth over which physics applies are illustrated by the wide range of examples of
known lengths, masses, and times (given as orders of magnitude) in Figure 1.4. Examining this table will give you a
feeling for the range of possible topics in physics and numerical values. A good way to appreciate the vastness of the ranges
of values in Figure 1.4 is to try to answer some simple comparative questions, such as the following:
•
How many hydrogen atoms does it take to stretch across the diameter of the Sun?
(Answer: 109 m/10–10 m = 1019 hydrogen atoms)
•
How many protons are there in a bacterium?
(Answer: 10–15 kg/10–27 kg = 1012 protons)
•
How many floating-point operations can a supercomputer do in 1 day?
(Answer: 105 s/10–17 s = 1022 floating-point operations)
In studying Figure 1.4, take some time to come up with similar questions that interest you and then try answering them.
Doing this can breathe some life into almost any table of numbers.

Building Models
How did we come to know the laws governing natural phenomena? What we refer to as the laws of nature are concise
descriptions of the universe around us. They are human statements of the underlying laws or rules that all natural processes
follow. Such laws are intrinsic to the universe; humans did not create them and cannot change them. We can only discover
and understand them. Their discovery is a very human endeavor, with all the elements of mystery, imagination, struggle,
triumph, and disappointment inherent in any creative effort (Figure 1.5). The cornerstone of discovering natural laws is
observation; scientists must describe the universe as it is, not as we imagine it to be.

A model is a representation of something that is often too difficult (or impossible) to display directly. Although a model
is justified by experimental tests, it is only accurate in describing certain aspects of a physical system. An example is the
Bohr model of single-electron atoms, in which the electron is pictured as orbiting the nucleus, analogous to the way planets
orbit the Sun (Figure 1.6). We cannot observe electron orbits directly, but the mental image helps explain some of the
observations we can make, such as the emission of light from hot gases (atomic spectra). However, other observations
show that the picture in the Bohr model is not really what atoms look like. The model is “wrong,” but is still useful for
some purposes. Physicists use models for a variety of purposes. For example, models can help physicists analyze a scenario
and perform a calculation or models can be used to represent a situation in the form of a computer simulation. Ultimately,
however, the results of these calculations and simulations need to be double-checked by other means—namely, observation
and experimentation.
Figure 1.6 What is a model? The Bohr model of a single-
electron atom shows the electron orbiting the nucleus in one of
several possible circular orbits. Like all models, it captures
some, but not all, aspects of the physical system.

The word theory means something different to scientists than what is often meant when the word is used in everyday
conversation. In particular, to a scientist a theory is not the same as a “guess” or an “idea” or even a “hypothesis.” The
phrase “it’s just a theory” seems meaningless and silly to scientists because science is founded on the notion of theories. To
a scientist, a theory is a testable explanation for patterns in nature supported by scientific evidence and verified multiple
times by various groups of researchers. Some theories include models to help visualize phenomena whereas others do not.
Newton’s theory of gravity, for example, does not require a model or mental image, because we can observe the objects
directly with our own senses. The kinetic theory of gases, on the other hand, is a model in which a gas is viewed as being
composed of atoms and molecules. Atoms and molecules are too small to be observed directly with our senses—thus, we
picture them mentally to understand what the instruments tell us about the behavior of gases. Although models are meant
only to describe certain aspects of a physical system accurately, a theory should describe all aspects of any system that falls
within its domain of applicability. In particular, any experimentally testable implication of a theory should be verified. If an
experiment ever shows an implication of a theory to be false, then the theory is either thrown out or modified suitably (for
example, by limiting its domain of applicability).
A law uses concise language to describe a generalized pattern in nature supported by scientific evidence and repeated
experiments. Often, a law can be expressed in the form of a single mathematical equation. Laws and theories are similar
in that they are both scientific statements that result from a tested hypothesis and are supported by scientific evidence.
However, the designation law is usually reserved for a concise and very general statement that describes phenomena in
nature, such as the law that energy is conserved during any process, or Newton’s second law of motion, which relates force
(F), mass (m), and acceleration (a) by the simple equation F = ma. A theory, in contrast, is a less concise statement of
observed behavior. For example, the theory of evolution and the theory of relativity cannot be expressed concisely enough to
be considered laws. The biggest difference between a law and a theory is that a theory is much more complex and dynamic.
A law describes a single action whereas a theory explains an entire group of related phenomena. Less broadly applicable
statements are usually called principles (such as Pascal’s principle, which is applicable only in fluids), but the distinction
between laws and principles often is not made carefully.
The models, theories, and laws we devise sometimes imply the existence of objects or phenomena that are as yet
unobserved. These predictions are remarkable triumphs and tributes to the power of science. It is the underlying order in
the universe that enables scientists to make such spectacular predictions. However, if experimentation does not verify our
predictions, then the theory or law is wrong, no matter how elegant or convenient it is. Laws can never be known with
absolute certainty because it is impossible to perform every imaginable experiment to confirm a law for every possible
scenario. Physicists operate under the assumption that all scientific laws and theories are valid until a counterexample is
observed. If a good-quality, verifiable experiment contradicts a well-established law or theory, then the law or theory must
be modified or overthrown completely.
The study of science in general, and physics in particular, is an adventure much like the exploration of an uncharted ocean.
Discoveries are made; models, theories, and laws are formulated; and the beauty of the physical universe is made more
sublime for the insights gained.
1.2 | Units and Standards
Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Describe how SI base units are defined.
•
Describe how derived units are created from base units.
•
Express quantities given in SI units using metric prefixes.
As we saw previously, the range of objects and phenomena studied in physics is immense. From the incredibly short lifetime
of a nucleus to the age of Earth, from the tiny sizes of subnuclear particles to the vast distance to the edges of the known
universe, from the force exerted by a jumping flea to the force between Earth and the Sun, there are enough factors of 10
to challenge the imagination of even the most experienced scientist. Giving numerical values for physical quantities and
equations for physical principles allows us to understand nature much more deeply than qualitative descriptions alone. To
comprehend these vast ranges, we must also have accepted units in which to express them. We shall find that even in the
potentially mundane discussion of meters, kilograms, and seconds, a profound simplicity of nature appears: all physical
quantities can be expressed as combinations of only seven base physical quantities.
14
Chapter 1 | Units and Measurement
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12031/1.10
We define a physical quantity either by specifying how it is measured or by stating how it is calculated from other
measurements. For example, we might define distance and time by specifying methods for measuring them, such as using
a meter stick and a stopwatch. Then, we could define average speed by stating that it is calculated as the total distance
traveled divided by time of travel.
Measurements of physical quantities are expressed in terms of units, which are standardized values. For example, the length
of a race, which is a physical quantity, can be expressed in units of meters (for sprinters) or kilometers (for distance runners).
Without standardized units, it would be extremely difficult for scientists to express and compare measured values in a
meaningful way (Figure 1.7).
Figure 1.7 Distances given in unknown units are maddeningly
useless.
Two major systems of units are used in the world: SI units (for the French Système International d’Unités), also known
as the metric system, and English units (also known as the customary or imperial system). English units were historically
used in nations once ruled by the British Empire and are still widely used in the United States. English units may also be
referred to as the foot–pound–second (fps) system, as opposed to the centimeter–gram–second (cgs) system. You may also
encounter the term SAE units, named after the Society of Automotive Engineers. Products such as fasteners and automotive
tools (for example, wrenches) that are measured in inches rather than metric units are referred to as SAE fasteners or SAE
wrenches.
Virtually every other country in the world (except the United States) now uses SI units as the standard. The metric system
is also the standard system agreed on by scientists and mathematicians.
SI Units: Base and Derived Units
In any system of units, the units for some physical quantities must be defined through a measurement process. These are
called the base quantities for that system and their units are the system’s base units. All other physical quantities can
then be expressed as algebraic combinations of the base quantities. Each of these physical quantities is then known as a
derived quantity and each unit is called a derived unit. The choice of base quantities is somewhat arbitrary, as long as they
are independent of each other and all other quantities can be derived from them. Typically, the goal is to choose physical
quantities that can be measured accurately to a high precision as the base quantities. The reason for this is simple. Since the
derived units can be expressed as algebraic combinations of the base units, they can only be as accurate and precise as the
base units from which they are derived.
Based on such considerations, the International Standards Organization recommends using seven base quantities, which
form the International System of Quantities (ISQ). These are the base quantities used to define the SI base units. Table 1.1
lists these seven ISQ base quantities and the corresponding SI base units.

Table 1.1 ISQ Base Quantities and Their SI Units
You are probably already familiar with some derived quantities that can be formed from the base quantities in Table 1.1.
For example, the geometric concept of area is always calculated as the product of two lengths. Thus, area is a derived
quantity that can be expressed in terms of SI base units using square meters (m × m = m2). Similarly, volume is a derived
quantity that can be expressed in cubic meters (m3). Speed is length per time; so in terms of SI base units, we could
measure it in meters per second (m/s). Volume mass density (or just density) is mass per volume, which is expressed in
terms of SI base units such as kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m3). Angles can also be thought of as derived quantities
because they can be defined as the ratio of the arc length subtended by two radii of a circle to the radius of the circle. This
is how the radian is defined. Depending on your background and interests, you may be able to come up with other derived
quantities, such as the mass flow rate (kg/s) or volume flow rate (m3/s) of a fluid, electric charge (A · s), mass flux density
[kg/(m2 · s)], and so on. We will see many more examples throughout this text. For now, the point is that every physical
quantity can be derived from the seven base quantities in Table 1.1, and the units of every physical quantity can be derived
from the seven SI base units.
For the most part, we use SI units in this text. Non-SI units are used in a few applications in which they are in very common
use, such as the measurement of temperature in degrees Celsius (°C),
the measurement of fluid volume in liters (L), and
the measurement of energies of elementary particles in electron-volts (eV). Whenever non-SI units are discussed, they are
tied to SI units through conversions. For example, 1 L is 10−3 m3.

Units of Time, Length, and Mass: The Second, Meter, and Kilogram
The initial chapters in this textbook are concerned with mechanics, fluids, and waves. In these subjects all pertinent physical
quantities can be expressed in terms of the base units of length, mass, and time. Therefore, we now turn to a discussion of
these three base units, leaving discussion of the others until they are needed later.
The second
The SI unit for time, the second (abbreviated s), has a long history. For many years it was defined as 1/86,400 of a mean
solar day. More recently, a new standard was adopted to gain greater accuracy and to define the second in terms of a
nonvarying or constant physical phenomenon (because the solar day is getting longer as a result of the very gradual slowing
of Earth’s rotation). Cesium atoms can be made to vibrate in a very steady way, and these vibrations can be readily observed
and counted. In 1967, the second was redefined as the time required for 9,192,631,770 of these vibrations to occur (Figure
1.8). Note that this may seem like more precision than you would ever need, but it isn’t—GPSs rely on the precision of
atomic clocks to be able to give you turn-by-turn directions on the surface of Earth, far from the satellites broadcasting their
location.

vibrations of cesium atoms to keep time to a precision of better
than a microsecond per year. The fundamental unit of time, the
second, is based on such clocks. This image looks down from
the top of an atomic fountain nearly 30 feet tall. (credit: Steve
Jurvetson)
The meter
The SI unit for length is the meter (abbreviated m); its definition has also changed over time to become more precise. The
meter was first defined in 1791 as 1/10,000,000 of the distance from the equator to the North Pole. This measurement was
improved in 1889 by redefining the meter to be the distance between two engraved lines on a platinum–iridium bar now
kept near Paris. By 1960, it had become possible to define the meter even more accurately in terms of the wavelength of
light, so it was again redefined as 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of orange light emitted by krypton atoms. In 1983, the meter
was given its current definition (in part for greater accuracy) as the distance light travels in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a
second (Figure 1.9). This change came after knowing the speed of light to be exactly 299,792,458 m/s. The length of the
meter will change if the speed of light is someday measured with greater accuracy.
Figure 1.9 The meter is defined to be the distance light travels in 1/299,792,458 of a second in a vacuum. Distance
traveled is speed multiplied by time.
The kilogram
The SI unit for mass is the kilogram (abbreviated kg); it is defined to be the mass of a platinum–iridium cylinder
kept with the old meter standard at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures near Paris. Exact replicas of the
standard kilogram are also kept at the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), located in Gaithersburg,
Maryland, outside of Washington, DC, and at other locations around the world. Scientists at NIST are currently investigating
two complementary methods of redefining the kilogram (see Figure 1.10). The determination of all other masses can be
traced ultimately to a comparison with the standard mass.
There is currently an effort to redefine the SI unit of mass in terms of more fundamental processes by 2018. You
can explore the history of mass standards and the contenders in the quest to devise a new one at the website

Metric Prefixes
SI units are part of the metric system, which is convenient for scientific and engineering calculations because the units are
categorized by factors of 10. Table 1.2 lists the metric prefixes and symbols used to denote various factors of 10 in SI units.
For example, a centimeter is one-hundredth of a meter (in symbols, 1 cm = 10–2 m) and a kilometer is a thousand meters (1
km = 103 m). Similarly, a megagram is a million grams (1 Mg = 106 g), a nanosecond is a billionth of a second (1 ns = 10–9
s), and a terameter is a trillion meters (1 Tm = 1012 m).

Table 1.2 Metric Prefixes for Powers of 10 and Their Symbols
The only rule when using metric prefixes is that you cannot “double them up.” For example, if you have measurements in
petameters (1 Pm = 1015 m), it is not proper to talk about megagigameters, although 106 × 109 = 1015. In practice, the

only time this becomes a bit confusing is when discussing masses. As we have seen, the base SI unit of mass is the kilogram
(kg), but metric prefixes need to be applied to the gram (g), because we are not allowed to “double-up” prefixes. Thus, a
thousand kilograms (103 kg) is written as a megagram (1 Mg) since
103 kg = 103 × 103 g = 106 g = 1 Mg.
Incidentally, 103 kg is also called a metric ton, abbreviated t. This is one of the units outside the SI system considered
acceptable for use with SI units.
As we see in the next section, metric systems have the advantage that conversions of units involve only powers of 10. There
are 100 cm in 1 m, 1000 m in 1 km, and so on. In nonmetric systems, such as the English system of units, the relationships
are not as simple—there are 12 in. in 1 ft, 5280 ft in 1 mi, and so on.
Another advantage of metric systems is that the same unit can be used over extremely large ranges of values simply by
scaling it with an appropriate metric prefix. The prefix is chosen by the order of magnitude of physical quantities commonly
found in the task at hand. For example, distances in meters are suitable in construction, whereas distances in kilometers are
appropriate for air travel, and nanometers are convenient in optical design. With the metric system there is no need to invent
new units for particular applications. Instead, we rescale the units with which we are already familiar.
Example 1.1
Using Metric Prefixes
Restate the mass 1.93 × 1013 kg using a metric prefix such that the resulting numerical value is bigger than one
but less than 1000.
Strategy
Since we are not allowed to “double-up” prefixes, we first need to restate the mass in grams by replacing the
prefix symbol k with a factor of 103 (see Table 1.2). Then, we should see which two prefixes in Table 1.2 are
closest to the resulting power of 10 when the number is written in scientific notation. We use whichever of these
two prefixes gives us a number between one and 1000.
Solution
Replacing the k in kilogram with a factor of 103, we find that
1.93 × 1013 kg = 1.93 × 1013 × 103 g = 1.93 × 1016 g.
From Table 1.2, we see that 1016 is between “peta-” (1015) and “exa-” (1018). If we use the “peta-” prefix, then
we find that 1.93 × 1016 g = 1.93 × 101 Pg,
since 16 = 1 + 15. Alternatively, if we use the “exa-” prefix we
find that 1.93 × 1016 g = 1.93 × 10−2Eg,
since 16 = −2 + 18. Because the problem asks for the numerical
value between one and 1000, we use the “peta-” prefix and the answer is 19.3 Pg.
Significance
It is easy to make silly arithmetic errors when switching from one prefix to another, so it is always a good idea to
check that our final answer matches the number we started with. An easy way to do this is to put both numbers in
scientific notation and count powers of 10, including the ones hidden in prefixes. If we did not make a mistake,
the powers of 10 should match up. In this problem, we started with 1.93 × 1013 kg, so we have 13 + 3 = 16
powers of 10. Our final answer in scientific notation is 1.93 × 101 Pg, so we have 1 + 15 = 16 powers of 10. So,
everything checks out.
If this mass arose from a calculation, we would also want to check to determine whether a mass this large makes
any sense in the context of the problem. For this, Figure 1.4 might be helpful.

is bigger than one but less than 1000.

1.3 | Unit Conversion
Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Use conversion factors to express the value of a given quantity in different units.
It is often necessary to convert from one unit to another. For example, if you are reading a European cookbook, some
quantities may be expressed in units of liters and you need to convert them to cups. Or perhaps you are reading walking
directions from one location to another and you are interested in how many miles you will be walking. In this case, you may
need to convert units of feet or meters to miles.
Let’s consider a simple example of how to convert units. Suppose we want to convert 80 m to kilometers. The first thing to
do is to list the units you have and the units to which you want to convert. In this case, we have units in meters and we want
to convert to kilometers. Next, we need to determine a conversion factor relating meters to kilometers. A conversion factor
is a ratio that expresses how many of one unit are equal to another unit. For example, there are 12 in. in 1 ft, 1609 m in 1
mi, 100 cm in 1 m, 60 s in 1 min, and so on. Refer to Appendix B for a more complete list of conversion factors. In this
case, we know that there are 1000 m in 1 km. Now we can set up our unit conversion. We write the units we have and then
multiply them by the conversion factor so the units cancel out, as shown:
80 m ×
1 km
1000 m = 0.080 km.
Note that the unwanted meter unit cancels, leaving only the desired kilometer unit. You can use this method to convert
between any type of unit. Now, the conversion of 80 m to kilometers is simply the use of a metric prefix, as we saw in the
preceding section, so we can get the same answer just as easily by noting that
80 m = 8.0 × 101 m = 8.0 × 10−2km = 0.080 km,
since “kilo-” means 103 (see Table 1.2) and 1 = −2 + 3. However, using conversion factors is handy when converting
between units that are not metric or when converting between derived units, as the following examples illustrate.
Example 1.2
Converting Nonmetric Units to Metric
The distance from the university to home is 10 mi and it usually takes 20 min to drive this distance. Calculate the
average speed in meters per second (m/s). (Note: Average speed is distance traveled divided by time of travel.)
Strategy
First we calculate the average speed using the given units, then we can get the average speed into the desired
units by picking the correct conversion factors and multiplying by them. The correct conversion factors are those
that cancel the unwanted units and leave the desired units in their place. In this case, we want to convert miles to
meters, so we need to know the fact that there are 1609 m in 1 mi. We also want to convert minutes to seconds,
so we use the conversion of 60 s in 1 min.
Solution
1.
Calculate average speed. Average speed is distance traveled divided by time of travel. (Take this definition
as a given for now. Average speed and other motion concepts are covered in later chapters.) In equation
form,
Average speed = Distance
Time .
2.
Substitute the given values for distance and time:
Average speed = 10 mi
20 min = 0.50 mi
min.
3.
Convert miles per minute to meters per second by multiplying by the conversion factor that cancels miles
and leave meters, and also by the conversion factor that cancels minutes and leave seconds:

m/s = 13 m/s.
Significance
Check the answer in the following ways:
1.
Be sure the units in the unit conversion cancel correctly. If the unit conversion factor was written upside
down, the units do not cancel correctly in the equation. We see the “miles” in the numerator in 0.50
mi/min cancels the “mile” in the denominator in the first conversion factor. Also, the “min” in the
denominator in 0.50 mi/min cancels the “min” in the numerator in the second conversion factor.
2.
Check that the units of the final answer are the desired units. The problem asked us to solve for average
speed in units of meters per second and, after the cancellations, the only units left are a meter (m) in the
numerator and a second (s) in the denominator, so we have indeed obtained these units.
Check Your Understanding Light travels about 9 Pm in a year. Given that a year is about 3 × 107 s,
what is the speed of light in meters per second?
Example 1.3
Converting between Metric Units
The density of iron is 7.86 g/cm3 under standard conditions. Convert this to kg/m3.
Strategy
We need to convert grams to kilograms and cubic centimeters to cubic meters. The conversion factors we need are
1 kg = 103 g and 1 cm = 10−2m. However, we are dealing with cubic centimeters (cm3 = cm × cm × cm),
so we have to use the second conversion factor three times (that is, we need to cube it). The idea is still to multiply
by the conversion factors in such a way that they cancel the units we want to get rid of and introduce the units we
want to keep.
Solution

Significance
Remember, it’s always important to check the answer.
1.
Be sure to cancel the units in the unit conversion correctly. We see that the gram (“g”) in the numerator
in 7.86 g/cm3 cancels the “g” in the denominator in the first conversion factor. Also, the three factors of
“cm” in the denominator in 7.86 g/cm3 cancel with the three factors of “cm” in the numerator that we get
by cubing the second conversion factor.
2.
Check that the units of the final answer are the desired units. The problem asked for us to convert to
kilograms per cubic meter. After the cancellations just described, we see the only units we have left are
“kg” in the numerator and three factors of “m” in the denominator (that is, one factor of “m” cubed, or
“m3”). Therefore, the units on the final answer are correct.
Check Your Understanding We know from Figure 1.4 that the diameter of Earth is on the order of 107
m, so the order of magnitude of its surface area is 1014 m2. What is that in square kilometers (that is, km2)? (Try
doing this both by converting 107 m to km and then squaring it and then by converting 1014 m2 directly to
square kilometers. You should get the same answer both ways.)
Unit conversions may not seem very interesting, but not doing them can be costly. One famous example of this situation was

seen with the Mars Climate Orbiter. This probe was launched by NASA on December 11, 1998. On September 23, 1999,
while attempting to guide the probe into its planned orbit around Mars, NASA lost contact with it. Subsequent investigations
showed a piece of software called SM_FORCES (or “small forces”) was recording thruster performance data in the English
units of pound-seconds (lb-s). However, other pieces of software that used these values for course corrections expected them
to be recorded in the SI units of newton-seconds (N-s), as dictated in the software interface protocols. This error caused the
probe to follow a very different trajectory from what NASA thought it was following, which most likely caused the probe
either to burn up in the Martian atmosphere or to shoot out into space. This failure to pay attention to unit conversions cost
hundreds of millions of dollars, not to mention all the time invested by the scientists and engineers who worked on the
project.
Check Your Understanding Given that 1 lb (pound) is 4.45 N, were the numbers being output by
SM_FORCES too big or too small?
1.4 | Dimensional Analysis
Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Find the dimensions of a mathematical expression involving physical quantities.
•
Determine whether an equation involving physical quantities is dimensionally consistent.
The dimension of any physical quantity expresses its dependence on the base quantities as a product of symbols (or powers
of symbols) representing the base quantities. Table 1.3 lists the base quantities and the symbols used for their dimension.
For example, a measurement of length is said to have dimension L or L1, a measurement of mass has dimension M or
M1, and a measurement of time has dimension T or T1. Like units, dimensions obey the rules of algebra. Thus, area is
the product of two lengths and so has dimension L2, or length squared. Similarly, volume is the product of three lengths
and has dimension L3, or length cubed. Speed has dimension length over time, L/T or LT–1. Volumetric mass density has
dimension M/L3 or ML–3, or mass over length cubed. In general, the dimension of any physical quantity can be written as
LaMb TcId ΘeN f Jg for some powers a, b, c, d, e, f, and g. We can write the dimensions of a length in this form with
a = 1 and the remaining six powers all set equal to zero: L1 = L1 M0 T0 I0 Θ0 N0 J0. Any quantity with a dimension that
can be written so that all seven powers are zero (that is, its dimension is L0 M0 T0 I0 Θ0 N0 J0 ) is called dimensionless
(or sometimes “of dimension 1,” because anything raised to the zero power is one). Physicists often call dimensionless
quantities pure numbers.

Table 1.3 Base Quantities and Their Dimensions
Physicists often use square brackets around the symbol for a physical quantity to represent the dimensions of that quantity.
For example, if r is the radius of a cylinder and h is its height, then we write [r] = L and [h] = L to indicate the
dimensions of the radius and height are both those of length, or L. Similarly, if we use the symbol A for the surface area of
a cylinder and V for its volume, then [A] = L2 and [V] = L3. If we use the symbol m for the mass of the cylinder and ρ
22
Chapter 1 | Units and Measurement

for the density of the material from which the cylinder is made, then [m] = M and [ρ] = ML−3.
The importance of the concept of dimension arises from the fact that any mathematical equation relating physical quantities
must be dimensionally consistent, which means the equation must obey the following rules:
•
Every term in an expression must have the same dimensions; it does not make sense to add or subtract quantities of
differing dimension (think of the old saying: “You can’t add apples and oranges”). In particular, the expressions on
each side of the equality in an equation must have the same dimensions.
•
The arguments of any of the standard mathematical functions such as trigonometric functions (such as sine and
cosine), logarithms, or exponential functions that appear in the equation must be dimensionless. These functions
require pure numbers as inputs and give pure numbers as outputs.
If either of these rules is violated, an equation is not dimensionally consistent and cannot possibly be a correct statement
of physical law. This simple fact can be used to check for typos or algebra mistakes, to help remember the various laws of
physics, and even to suggest the form that new laws of physics might take. This last use of dimensions is beyond the scope
of this text, but is something you will undoubtedly learn later in your academic career.
Example 1.4
Using Dimensions to Remember an Equation
Suppose we need the formula for the area of a circle for some computation. Like many people who learned
geometry too long ago to recall with any certainty, two expressions may pop into our mind when we think of
circles: πr2 and 2πr. One expression is the circumference of a circle of radius r and the other is its area. But
which is which?
Strategy
One natural strategy is to look it up, but this could take time to find information from a reputable source. Besides,
even if we think the source is reputable, we shouldn’t trust everything we read. It is nice to have a way to double-
check just by thinking about it. Also, we might be in a situation in which we cannot look things up (such as during
a test). Thus, the strategy is to find the dimensions of both expressions by making use of the fact that dimensions
follow the rules of algebra. If either expression does not have the same dimensions as area, then it cannot possibly
be the correct equation for the area of a circle.
Solution
We know the dimension of area is L2. Now, the dimension of the expression πr2 is
[πr2] = [π] · [r]2 = 1 · L2 = L2,
since the constant π is a pure number and the radius r is a length. Therefore, πr2 has the dimension of area.
Similarly, the dimension of the expression 2πr is
[2πr] = [2] · [π] · [r] = 1 · 1 · L = L,
since the constants 2 and π are both dimensionless and the radius r is a length. We see that 2πr has the
dimension of length, which means it cannot possibly be an area.
We rule out 2πr because it is not dimensionally consistent with being an area. We see that πr2 is dimensionally
consistent with being an area, so if we have to choose between these two expressions, πr2 is the one to choose.
Significance
This may seem like kind of a silly example, but the ideas are very general. As long as we know the dimensions
of the individual physical quantities that appear in an equation, we can check to see whether the equation is
dimensionally consistent. On the other hand, knowing that true equations are dimensionally consistent, we can
match expressions from our imperfect memories to the quantities for which they might be expressions. Doing this
will not help us remember dimensionless factors that appear in the equations (for example, if you had accidentally
conflated the two expressions from the example into 2πr2,
then dimensional analysis is no help), but it does
help us remember the correct basic form of equations.

Check Your Understanding Suppose we want the formula for the volume of a sphere. The two
expressions commonly mentioned in elementary discussions of spheres are 4πr2 and 4πr3 /3. One is the
volume of a sphere of radius r and the other is its surface area. Which one is the volume?
Example 1.5
Checking Equations for Dimensional Consistency
Consider the physical quantities s,
v,
a,
and t with dimensions [s] = L,
[v] = LT −1,
[a] = LT −2,
and
[t] = T.
Determine whether each of the following equations is dimensionally consistent: (a)
s = vt + 0.5at2; (b) s = vt2 + 0.5at; and (c) v = sin(at2 /s).
Strategy
By the definition of dimensional consistency, we need to check that each term in a given equation has the same
dimensions as the other terms in that equation and that the arguments of any standard mathematical functions are
dimensionless.
Solution
a.
There are no trigonometric, logarithmic, or exponential functions to worry about in this equation, so we
need only look at the dimensions of each term appearing in the equation. There are three terms, one in the
left expression and two in the expression on the right, so we look at each in turn:
[s] = L
[vt] = [v] · [t] = LT −1 · T = LT 0 = L
[0.5at2] = [a] · [t]2 = LT −2 · T2 = LT 0 = L.
All three terms have the same dimension, so this equation is dimensionally consistent.
b.
Again, there are no trigonometric, exponential, or logarithmic functions, so we only need to look at the
dimensions of each of the three terms appearing in the equation:
[s] = L
[vt2] = [v] · [t]2 = LT −1 · T2 = LT
[at] = [a] · [t] = LT −2 · T = LT −1.
None of the three terms has the same dimension as any other, so this is about as far from being
dimensionally consistent as you can get. The technical term for an equation like this is nonsense.
c.
This equation has a trigonometric function in it, so first we should check that the argument of the sine
function is dimensionless:
⎡
⎣
at2
s
⎤
⎦= [a] · [t]2
[s]
= LT −2 · T2
L
= L
L = 1.
The argument is dimensionless. So far, so good. Now we need to check the dimensions of each of the two
terms (that is, the left expression and the right expression) in the equation:
[v] = LT −1
⎡
⎣sin⎛
⎝
at2
s
⎞
⎠
⎤
⎦= 1.
The two terms have different dimensions—meaning, the equation is not dimensionally consistent. This equation
is another example of “nonsense.”
Significance
If we are trusting people, these types of dimensional checks might seem unnecessary. But, rest assured, any
24
Chapter 1 | Units and Measurement

1.6
textbook on a quantitative subject such as physics (including this one) almost certainly contains some equations
with typos. Checking equations routinely by dimensional analysis save us the embarrassment of using an incorrect
equation. Also, checking the dimensions of an equation we obtain through algebraic manipulation is a great way
to make sure we did not make a mistake (or to spot a mistake, if we made one).
Check Your Understanding Is the equation v = at dimensionally consistent?
One further point that needs to be mentioned is the effect of the operations of calculus on dimensions. We have seen that
dimensions obey the rules of algebra, just like units, but what happens when we take the derivative of one physical quantity
with respect to another or integrate a physical quantity over another? The derivative of a function is just the slope of the line
tangent to its graph and slopes are ratios, so for physical quantities v and t, we have that the dimension of the derivative of
v with respect to t is just the ratio of the dimension of v over that of t:
⎡
⎣dv
dt
⎤
⎦= [v]
[t].
Similarly, since integrals are just sums of products, the dimension of the integral of v with respect to t is simply the
dimension of v times the dimension of t:
⎡
⎣∫vdt⎤
⎦= [v] · [t].
By the same reasoning, analogous rules hold for the units of physical quantities derived from other quantities by integration
or differentiation.
1.5 | Estimates and Fermi Calculations
Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Estimate the values of physical quantities.
On many occasions, physicists, other scientists, and engineers need to make estimates for a particular quantity. Other
terms sometimes used are guesstimates, order-of-magnitude approximations, back-of-the-envelope calculations, or Fermi
calculations. (The physicist Enrico Fermi mentioned earlier was famous for his ability to estimate various kinds of data with
surprising precision.) Will that piece of equipment fit in the back of the car or do we need to rent a truck? How long will
this download take? About how large a current will there be in this circuit when it is turned on? How many houses could
a proposed power plant actually power if it is built? Note that estimating does not mean guessing a number or a formula
at random. Rather, estimation means using prior experience and sound physical reasoning to arrive at a rough idea of a
quantity’s value. Because the process of determining a reliable approximation usually involves the identification of correct
physical principles and a good guess about the relevant variables, estimating is very useful in developing physical intuition.
Estimates also allow us perform “sanity checks” on calculations or policy proposals by helping us rule out certain scenarios
or unrealistic numbers. They allow us to challenge others (as well as ourselves) in our efforts to learn truths about the world.
Many estimates are based on formulas in which the input quantities are known only to a limited precision. As you develop
physics problem-solving skills (which are applicable to a wide variety of fields), you also will develop skills at estimating.
You develop these skills by thinking more quantitatively and by being willing to take risks. As with any skill, experience
helps. Familiarity with dimensions (see Table 1.3) and units (see Table 1.1 and Table 1.2), and the scales of base
quantities (see Figure 1.4) also helps.
To make some progress in estimating, you need to have some definite ideas about how variables may be related. The
following strategies may help you in practicing the art of estimation:
•
Get big lengths from smaller lengths. When estimating lengths, remember that anything can be a ruler. Thus,
imagine breaking a big thing into smaller things, estimate the length of one of the smaller things, and multiply to
get the length of the big thing. For example, to estimate the height of a building, first count how many floors it
has. Then, estimate how big a single floor is by imagining how many people would have to stand on each other’s
Chapter 1 | Units and Measurement
25
shoulders to reach the ceiling. Last, estimate the height of a person. The product of these three estimates is your
estimate of the height of the building. It helps to have memorized a few length scales relevant to the sorts of
problems you find yourself solving. For example, knowing some of the length scales in Figure 1.4 might come
in handy. Sometimes it also helps to do this in reverse—that is, to estimate the length of a small thing, imagine a
bunch of them making up a bigger thing. For example, to estimate the thickness of a sheet of paper, estimate the
thickness of a stack of paper and then divide by the number of pages in the stack. These same strategies of breaking
big things into smaller things or aggregating smaller things into a bigger thing can sometimes be used to estimate
other physical quantities, such as masses and times.
•
Get areas and volumes from lengths. When dealing with an area or a volume of a complex object, introduce a simple
model of the object such as a sphere or a box. Then, estimate the linear dimensions (such as the radius of the sphere
or the length, width, and height of the box) first, and use your estimates to obtain the volume or area from standard
geometric formulas. If you happen to have an estimate of an object’s area or volume, you can also do the reverse;
that is, use standard geometric formulas to get an estimate of its linear dimensions.
•
Get masses from volumes and densities. When estimating masses of objects, it can help first to estimate its volume
and then to estimate its mass from a rough estimate of its average density (recall, density has dimension mass over
length cubed, so mass is density times volume). For this, it helps to remember that the density of air is around 1 kg/
m3, the density of water is 103 kg/m3, and the densest everyday solids max out at around 104 kg/m3. Asking yourself
whether an object floats or sinks in either air or water gets you a ballpark estimate of its density. You can also do
this the other way around; if you have an estimate of an object’s mass and its density, you can use them to get an
estimate of its volume.
•
If all else fails, bound it. For physical quantities for which you do not have a lot of intuition, sometimes the best
you can do is think something like: Well, it must be bigger than this and smaller than that. For example, suppose
you need to estimate the mass of a moose. Maybe you have a lot of experience with moose and know their average
mass offhand. If so, great. But for most people, the best they can do is to think something like: It must be bigger
than a person (of order 102 kg) and less than a car (of order 103 kg). If you need a single number for a subsequent
calculation, you can take the geometric mean of the upper and lower bound—that is, you multiply them together
and then take the square root. For the moose mass example, this would be
⎛
⎝102 × 103⎞
⎠
0.5
= 102.5 = 100.5 × 102 ≈3 × 102 kg.
The tighter the bounds, the better. Also, no rules are unbreakable when it comes to estimation. If you think the value
of the quantity is likely to be closer to the upper bound than the lower bound, then you may want to bump up your
estimate from the geometric mean by an order or two of magnitude.
•
One “sig. fig.” is fine. There is no need to go beyond one significant figure when doing calculations to obtain an
estimate. In most cases, the order of magnitude is good enough. The goal is just to get in the ballpark figure, so keep
the arithmetic as simple as possible.
•
Ask yourself: Does this make any sense? Last, check to see whether your answer is reasonable. How does it compare
with the values of other quantities with the same dimensions that you already know or can look up easily? If you
get some wacky answer (for example, if you estimate the mass of the Atlantic Ocean to be bigger than the mass of
Earth, or some time span to be longer than the age of the universe), first check to see whether your units are correct.
Then, check for arithmetic errors. Then, rethink the logic you used to arrive at your answer. If everything checks
out, you may have just proved that some slick new idea is actually bogus.
Example 1.6
Mass of Earth’s Oceans
Estimate the total mass of the oceans on Earth.
Strategy
We know the density of water is about 103 kg/m3, so we start with the advice to “get masses from densities
and volumes.” Thus, we need to estimate the volume of the planet’s oceans. Using the advice to “get areas and
volumes from lengths,” we can estimate the volume of the oceans as surface area times average depth, or V = AD.
We know the diameter of Earth from Figure 1.4 and we know that most of Earth’s surface is covered in water,
so we can estimate the surface area of the oceans as being roughly equal to the surface area of the planet. By

following the advice to “get areas and volumes from lengths” again, we can approximate Earth as a sphere and
use the formula for the surface area of a sphere of diameter d—that is, A = πd2,
to estimate the surface area of
the oceans. Now we just need to estimate the average depth of the oceans. For this, we use the advice: “If all else
fails, bound it.” We happen to know the deepest points in the ocean are around 10 km and that it is not uncommon
for the ocean to be deeper than 1 km, so we take the average depth to be around (103 × 104)0.5 ≈3 × 103 m.
Now we just need to put it all together, heeding the advice that “one ‘sig. fig.’ is fine.”
Solution
We estimate the surface area of Earth (and hence the surface area of Earth’s oceans) to be roughly
A = πd2 = π(107 m)2 ≈3 × 1014 m2.
Next, using our average depth estimate of D = 3 × 103 m, which was obtained by bounding, we estimate the
volume of Earth’s oceans to be
V = AD = (3 × 1014 m2)(3 × 103 m) = 9 × 1017 m3.
Last, we estimate the mass of the world’s oceans to be
M = ρV = (103 kg/m3)(9 × 1017 m3) = 9 × 1020 kg.
Thus, we estimate that the order of magnitude of the mass of the planet’s oceans is 1021 kg.
Significance
To verify our answer to the best of our ability, we first need to answer the question: Does this make any sense?
From Figure 1.4, we see the mass of Earth’s atmosphere is on the order of 1019 kg and the mass of Earth is on
the order of 1025 kg. It is reassuring that our estimate of 1021 kg for the mass of Earth’s oceans falls somewhere
between these two. So, yes, it does seem to make sense. It just so happens that we did a search on the Web for
“mass of oceans” and the top search results all said 1.4 × 1021 kg, which is the same order of magnitude as our
estimate. Now, rather than having to trust blindly whoever first put that number up on a website (most of the other
sites probably just copied it from them, after all), we can have a little more confidence in it.
Check Your Understanding Figure 1.4 says the mass of the atmosphere is 1019 kg. Assuming the
density of the atmosphere is 1 kg/m3, estimate the height of Earth’s atmosphere. Do you think your answer is an
underestimate or an overestimate? Explain why.
How many piano tuners are there in New York City? How many leaves are on that tree? If you are studying photosynthesis
or thinking of writing a smartphone app for piano tuners, then the answers to these questions might be of great interest to
you. Otherwise, you probably couldn’t care less what the answers are. However, these are exactly the sorts of estimation
problems that people in various tech industries have been asking potential employees to evaluate their quantitative reasoning
skills. If building physical intuition and evaluating quantitative claims do not seem like sufficient reasons for you to practice
estimation problems, how about the fact that being good at them just might land you a high-paying job?

Figure 1.11 shows two instruments used to measure the mass of an object. The digital scale has mostly replaced the
double-pan balance in physics labs because it gives more accurate and precise measurements. But what exactly do we
mean by accurate and precise? Aren’t they the same thing? In this section we examine in detail the process of making and
reporting a measurement.
Figure 1.11 (a) A double-pan mechanical balance is used to compare different masses. Usually an object with unknown mass
is placed in one pan and objects of known mass are placed in the other pan. When the bar that connects the two pans is
horizontal, then the masses in both pans are equal. The “known masses” are typically metal cylinders of standard mass such as 1
g, 10 g, and 100 g. (b) Many mechanical balances, such as double-pan balances, have been replaced by digital scales, which can
typically measure the mass of an object more precisely. A mechanical balance may read only the mass of an object to the nearest
tenth of a gram, but many digital scales can measure the mass of an object up to the nearest thousandth of a gram. (credit a:

Accuracy and Precision of a Measurement
Science is based on observation and experiment—that is, on measurements. Accuracy is how close a measurement is to the
accepted reference value for that measurement. For example, let’s say we want to measure the length of standard printer
paper. The packaging in which we purchased the paper states that it is 11.0 in. long. We then measure the length of the paper
three times and obtain the following measurements: 11.1 in., 11.2 in., and 10.9 in. These measurements are quite accurate
because they are very close to the reference value of 11.0 in. In contrast, if we had obtained a measurement of 12 in., our
measurement would not be very accurate. Notice that the concept of accuracy requires that an accepted reference value be
given.
The precision of measurements refers to how close the agreement is between repeated independent measurements (which
are repeated under the same conditions). Consider the example of the paper measurements. The precision of the
measurements refers to the spread of the measured values. One way to analyze the precision of the measurements is to
determine the range, or difference, between the lowest and the highest measured values. In this case, the lowest value was
10.9 in. and the highest value was 11.2 in. Thus, the measured values deviated from each other by, at most, 0.3 in. These
measurements were relatively precise because they did not vary too much in value. However, if the measured values had
been 10.9 in., 11.1 in., and 11.9 in., then the measurements would not be very precise because there would be significant
28
Chapter 1 | Units and Measurement
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12031/1.10
variation from one measurement to another. Notice that the concept of precision depends only on the actual measurements
acquired and does not depend on an accepted reference value.
The measurements in the paper example are both accurate and precise, but in some cases, measurements are accurate but
not precise, or they are precise but not accurate. Let’s consider an example of a GPS attempting to locate the position
of a restaurant in a city. Think of the restaurant location as existing at the center of a bull’s-eye target and think of each
GPS attempt to locate the restaurant as a black dot. In Figure 1.12(a), we see the GPS measurements are spread out far
apart from each other, but they are all relatively close to the actual location of the restaurant at the center of the target.
This indicates a low-precision, high-accuracy measuring system. However, in Figure 1.12(b), the GPS measurements are
concentrated quite closely to one another, but they are far away from the target location. This indicates a high-precision,
low-accuracy measuring system.
Figure 1.12 A GPS attempts to locate a restaurant at the center of the bull’s-eye. The
black dots represent each attempt to pinpoint the location of the restaurant. (a) The dots
are spread out quite far apart from one another, indicating low precision, but they are each
rather close to the actual location of the restaurant, indicating high accuracy. (b) The dots
are concentrated rather closely to one another, indicating high precision, but they are
rather far away from the actual location of the restaurant, indicating low accuracy. (credit

Accuracy, Precision, Uncertainty, and Discrepancy
The precision of a measuring system is related to the uncertainty in the measurements whereas the accuracy is related
to the discrepancy from the accepted reference value. Uncertainty is a quantitative measure of how much your measured
values deviate from one another. There are many different methods of calculating uncertainty, each of which is appropriate
to different situations. Some examples include taking the range (that is, the biggest less the smallest) or finding the standard
deviation of the measurements. Discrepancy (or “measurement error”) is the difference between the measured value and a
given standard or expected value. If the measurements are not very precise, then the uncertainty of the values is high. If the
measurements are not very accurate, then the discrepancy of the values is high.
Recall our example of measuring paper length; we obtained measurements of 11.1 in., 11.2 in., and 10.9 in., and the accepted
value was 11.0 in. We might average the three measurements to say our best guess is 11.1 in.; in this case, our discrepancy
is 11.1 – 11.0 = 0.1 in., which provides a quantitative measure of accuracy. We might calculate the uncertainty in our best
guess by using the range of our measured values: 0.3 in. Then we would say the length of the paper is 11.1 in. plus or minus
0.3 in. The uncertainty in a measurement, A, is often denoted as δA (read “delta A”), so the measurement result would be
recorded as A ± δA. Returning to our paper example, the measured length of the paper could be expressed as 11.1 ± 0.3
in. Since the discrepancy of 0.1 in. is less than the uncertainty of 0.3 in., we might say the measured value agrees with the
accepted reference value to within experimental uncertainty.
Some factors that contribute to uncertainty in a measurement include the following:
•
Limitations of the measuring device
•
The skill of the person taking the measurement
•
Irregularities in the object being measured
•
Any other factors that affect the outcome (highly dependent on the situation)
In our example, such factors contributing to the uncertainty could be the smallest division on the ruler is 1/16 in., the person
using the ruler has bad eyesight, the ruler is worn down on one end, or one side of the paper is slightly longer than the other.
Chapter 1 | Units and Measurement
29
1.8
At any rate, the uncertainty in a measurement must be calculated to quantify its precision. If a reference value is known, it
makes sense to calculate the discrepancy as well to quantify its accuracy.
Percent uncertainty
Another method of expressing uncertainty is as a percent of the measured value. If a measurement A is expressed with
uncertainty δA, the percent uncertainty is defined as
Percent uncertainty = δA
A × 100%.
Example 1.7
Calculating Percent Uncertainty: A Bag of Apples
A grocery store sells 5-lb bags of apples. Let’s say we purchase four bags during the course of a month and weigh
the bags each time. We obtain the following measurements:
•
Week 1 weight: 4.8 lb
•
Week 2 weight: 5.3 lb
•
Week 3 weight: 4.9 lb
•
Week 4 weight: 5.4 lb
We then determine the average weight of the 5-lb bag of apples is 5.1 ± 0.2 lb. What is the percent uncertainty of
the bag’s weight?
Strategy
First, observe that the average value of the bag’s weight, A, is 5.1 lb. The uncertainty in this value, δA, is 0.2 lb.
We can use the following equation to determine the percent uncertainty of the weight:
(1.1)
Percent uncertainty = δA
A × 100%.
Solution
Substitute the values into the equation:
Percent uncertainty = δA
A × 100% = 0.2 lb
5.1 lb × 100% = 3.9% ≈4%.
Significance
We can conclude the average weight of a bag of apples from this store is 5.1 lb ± 4%. Notice the percent
uncertainty is dimensionless because the units of weight in δA = 0.2 lb canceled those in A = 5.1 lb when we
took the ratio.
Check Your Understanding A high school track coach has just purchased a new stopwatch. The
stopwatch manual states the stopwatch has an uncertainty of ±0.05 s. Runners on the track coach’s team
regularly clock 100-m sprints of 11.49 s to 15.01 s. At the school’s last track meet, the first-place sprinter came
in at 12.04 s and the second-place sprinter came in at 12.07 s. Will the coach’s new stopwatch be helpful in
timing the sprint team? Why or why not?
Uncertainties in calculations
Uncertainty exists in anything calculated from measured quantities. For example, the area of a floor calculated from
measurements of its length and width has an uncertainty because the length and width have uncertainties. How big is the
uncertainty in something you calculate by multiplication or division? If the measurements going into the calculation have
small uncertainties (a few percent or less), then the method of adding percents can be used for multiplication or division.
This method states the percent uncertainty in a quantity calculated by multiplication or division is the sum of the percent
30
Chapter 1 | Units and Measurement
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12031/1.10
uncertainties in the items used to make the calculation. For example, if a floor has a length of 4.00 m and a width of 3.00 m,
with uncertainties of 2% and 1%, respectively, then the area of the floor is 12.0 m2 and has an uncertainty of 3%. (Expressed
as an area, this is 0.36 m2 [ 12.0 m2 × 0.03 ], which we round to 0.4 m2 since the area of the floor is given to a tenth of a
square meter.)
Precision of Measuring Tools and Significant Figures
An important factor in the precision of measurements involves the precision of the measuring tool. In general, a precise
measuring tool is one that can measure values in very small increments. For example, a standard ruler can measure length to
the nearest millimeter whereas a caliper can measure length to the nearest 0.01 mm. The caliper is a more precise measuring
tool because it can measure extremely small differences in length. The more precise the measuring tool, the more precise
the measurements.
When we express measured values, we can only list as many digits as we measured initially with our measuring tool. For
example, if we use a standard ruler to measure the length of a stick, we may measure it to be 36.7 cm. We can’t express this
value as 36.71 cm because our measuring tool is not precise enough to measure a hundredth of a centimeter. It should be
noted that the last digit in a measured value has been estimated in some way by the person performing the measurement. For
example, the person measuring the length of a stick with a ruler notices the stick length seems to be somewhere in between
36.6 cm and 36.7 cm, and he or she must estimate the value of the last digit. Using the method of significant figures, the
rule is that the last digit written down in a measurement is the first digit with some uncertainty. To determine the number
of significant digits in a value, start with the first measured value at the left and count the number of digits through the last
digit written on the right. For example, the measured value 36.7 cm has three digits, or three significant figures. Significant
figures indicate the precision of the measuring tool used to measure a value.
Zeros
Special consideration is given to zeros when counting significant figures. The zeros in 0.053 are not significant because
they are placeholders that locate the decimal point. There are two significant figures in 0.053. The zeros in 10.053 are
not placeholders; they are significant. This number has five significant figures. The zeros in 1300 may or may not be
significant, depending on the style of writing numbers. They could mean the number is known to the last digit or they
could be placeholders. So 1300 could have two, three, or four significant figures. To avoid this ambiguity, we should write
1300 in scientific notation as 1.3 × 103,
1.30 × 103,
or 1.300 × 103,
depending on whether it has two, three, or four
significant figures. Zeros are significant except when they serve only as placeholders.
Significant figures in calculations
When combining measurements with different degrees of precision, the number of significant digits in the final answer can
be no greater than the number of significant digits in the least-precise measured value. There are two different rules, one
for multiplication and division and the other for addition and subtraction.
1.
For multiplication and division, the result should have the same number of significant figures as the quantity
with the least number of significant figures entering into the calculation. For example, the area of a circle can be
calculated from its radius using A = πr2. Let’s see how many significant figures the area has if the radius has only
two—say, r = 1.2 m. Using a calculator with an eight-digit output, we would calculate
A = πr2 = (3.1415927…) × (1.2 m)2 = 4.5238934 m2.
But because the radius has only two significant figures, it limits the calculated quantity to two significant figures, or
A = 4.5 m2,
although π is good to at least eight digits.
2.
For addition and subtraction, the answer can contain no more decimal places than the least-precise measurement.
Suppose we buy 7.56 kg of potatoes in a grocery store as measured with a scale with precision 0.01 kg, then we drop
off 6.052 kg of potatoes at your laboratory as measured by a scale with precision 0.001 kg. Then, we go home and
add 13.7 kg of potatoes as measured by a bathroom scale with precision 0.1 kg. How many kilograms of potatoes do
we now have and how many significant figures are appropriate in the answer? The mass is found by simple addition
and subtraction:
Chapter 1 | Units and Measurement
31
7.56 kg
−6.052 kg
+13.7 kg
15.208 kg = 15.2 kg.
Next, we identify the least-precise measurement: 13.7 kg. This measurement is expressed to the 0.1 decimal place,
so our final answer must also be expressed to the 0.1 decimal place. Thus, the answer is rounded to the tenths place,
giving us 15.2 kg.
Significant figures in this text
In this text, most numbers are assumed to have three significant figures. Furthermore, consistent numbers of significant
figures are used in all worked examples. An answer given to three digits is based on input good to at least three digits,
for example. If the input has fewer significant figures, the answer will also have fewer significant figures. Care is also
taken that the number of significant figures is reasonable for the situation posed. In some topics, particularly in optics, more
accurate numbers are needed and we use more than three significant figures. Finally, if a number is exact, such as the two
in the formula for the circumference of a circle, C = 2πr, it does not affect the number of significant figures in a calculation.
Likewise, conversion factors such as 100 cm/1 m are considered exact and do not affect the number of significant figures in
a calculation.

to apply broad physical principles—usually represented by equations—to specific situations is a very powerful form of
knowledge. It is much more powerful than memorizing a list of facts. Analytical skills and problem-solving abilities can be
applied to new situations whereas a list of facts cannot be made long enough to contain every possible circumstance. Such
analytical skills are useful both for solving problems in this text and for applying physics in everyday life.
As you are probably well aware, a certain amount of creativity and insight is required to solve problems. No rigid procedure
works every time. Creativity and insight grow with experience. With practice, the basics of problem solving become almost
automatic. One way to get practice is to work out the text’s examples for yourself as you read. Another is to work as
many end-of-section problems as possible, starting with the easiest to build confidence and then progressing to the more
difficult. After you become involved in physics, you will see it all around you, and you can begin to apply it to situations
you encounter outside the classroom, just as is done in many of the applications in this text.
Although there is no simple step-by-step method that works for every problem, the following three-stage process facilitates
problem solving and makes it more meaningful. The three stages are strategy, solution, and significance. This process is
used in examples throughout the book. Here, we look at each stage of the process in turn.
Strategy
Strategy is the beginning stage of solving a problem. The idea is to figure out exactly what the problem is and then develop
a strategy for solving it. Some general advice for this stage is as follows:
•
Examine the situation to determine which physical principles are involved. It often helps to draw a simple sketch
at the outset. You often need to decide which direction is positive and note that on your sketch. When you have
identified the physical principles, it is much easier to find and apply the equations representing those principles.
Although finding the correct equation is essential, keep in mind that equations represent physical principles, laws of
nature, and relationships among physical quantities. Without a conceptual understanding of a problem, a numerical
solution is meaningless.
•
Make a list of what is given or can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the “knowns”). Many problems
are stated very succinctly and require some inspection to determine what is known. Drawing a sketch can be very
useful at this point as well. Formally identifying the knowns is of particular importance in applying physics to real-
world situations. For example, the word stopped means the velocity is zero at that instant. Also, we can often take
initial time and position as zero by the appropriate choice of coordinate system.
•
Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknowns). In complex problems,
especially, it is not always obvious what needs to be found or in what sequence. Making a list can help identify the
unknowns.
•
Determine which physical principles can help you solve the problem. Since physical principles tend to be expressed
in the form of mathematical equations, a list of knowns and unknowns can help here. It is easiest if you can find
equations that contain only one unknown—that is, all the other variables are known—so you can solve for the
unknown easily. If the equation contains more than one unknown, then additional equations are needed to solve the
problem. In some problems, several unknowns must be determined to get at the one needed most. In such problems
it is especially important to keep physical principles in mind to avoid going astray in a sea of equations. You may
have to use two (or more) different equations to get the final answer.
Solution
The solution stage is when you do the math. Substitute the knowns (along with their units) into the appropriate equation
and obtain numerical solutions complete with units. That is, do the algebra, calculus, geometry, or arithmetic necessary to
find the unknown from the knowns, being sure to carry the units through the calculations. This step is clearly important
because it produces the numerical answer, along with its units. Notice, however, that this stage is only one-third of the
overall problem-solving process.
Significance
After having done the math in the solution stage of problem solving, it is tempting to think you are done. But, always
remember that physics is not math. Rather, in doing physics, we use mathematics as a tool to help us understand nature. So,
after you obtain a numerical answer, you should always assess its significance:
•
Check your units. If the units of the answer are incorrect, then an error has been made and you should go back over
your previous steps to find it. One way to find the mistake is to check all the equations you derived for dimensional
consistency. However, be warned that correct units do not guarantee the numerical part of the answer is also correct.
Chapter 1 | Units and Measurement
33
•
Check the answer to see whether it is reasonable. Does it make sense? This step is extremely important: –the goal
of physics is to describe nature accurately. To determine whether the answer is reasonable, check both its magnitude
and its sign, in addition to its units. The magnitude should be consistent with a rough estimate of what it should
be. It should also compare reasonably with magnitudes of other quantities of the same type. The sign usually tells
you about direction and should be consistent with your prior expectations. Your judgment will improve as you solve
more physics problems, and it will become possible for you to make finer judgments regarding whether nature is
described adequately by the answer to a problem. This step brings the problem back to its conceptual meaning. If
you can judge whether the answer is reasonable, you have a deeper understanding of physics than just being able to
solve a problem mechanically.
•
Check to see whether the answer tells you something interesting. What does it mean? This is the flip side of the
question: Does it make sense? Ultimately, physics is about understanding nature, and we solve physics problems to
learn a little something about how nature operates. Therefore, assuming the answer does make sense, you should
always take a moment to see if it tells you something about the world that you find interesting. Even if the answer to
this particular problem is not very interesting to you, what about the method you used to solve it? Could the method
be adapted to answer a question that you do find interesting? In many ways, it is in answering questions such as
these that science progresses.

SUMMARY
1.1 The Scope and Scale of Physics
•
Physics is about trying to find the simple laws that describe all natural phenomena.
•
Physics operates on a vast range of scales of length, mass, and time. Scientists use the concept of the order of
magnitude of a number to track which phenomena occur on which scales. They also use orders of magnitude to
compare the various scales.
•
Scientists attempt to describe the world by formulating models, theories, and laws.
1.2 Units and Standards
•
Systems of units are built up from a small number of base units, which are defined by accurate and precise
measurements of conventionally chosen base quantities. Other units are then derived as algebraic combinations of
the base units.
•
Two commonly used systems of units are English units and SI units. All scientists and most of the other people in
the world use SI, whereas nonscientists in the United States still tend to use English units.
•
The SI base units of length, mass, and time are the meter (m), kilogram (kg), and second (s), respectively.
•
SI units are a metric system of units, meaning values can be calculated by factors of 10. Metric prefixes may be
used with metric units to scale the base units to sizes appropriate for almost any application.
1.3 Unit Conversion
•
To convert a quantity from one unit to another, multiply by conversions factors in such a way that you cancel the
units you want to get rid of and introduce the units you want to end up with.
•
Be careful with areas and volumes. Units obey the rules of algebra so, for example, if a unit is squared we need two
factors to cancel it.
1.4 Dimensional Analysis
•
The dimension of a physical quantity is just an expression of the base quantities from which it is derived.
•
All equations expressing physical laws or principles must be dimensionally consistent. This fact can be used as an
aid in remembering physical laws, as a way to check whether claimed relationships between physical quantities are
possible, and even to derive new physical laws.
1.5 Estimates and Fermi Calculations
•
An estimate is a rough educated guess at the value of a physical quantity based on prior experience and sound
physical reasoning. Some strategies that may help when making an estimate are as follows:
◦
Get big lengths from smaller lengths.
◦
Get areas and volumes from lengths.
◦
Get masses from volumes and densities.
◦
If all else fails, bound it.

1.6 Significant Figures
•
Accuracy of a measured value refers to how close a measurement is to an accepted reference value. The discrepancy
in a measurement is the amount by which the measurement result differs from this value.
•
Precision of measured values refers to how close the agreement is between repeated measurements. The uncertainty
of a measurement is a quantification of this.
•
The precision of a measuring tool is related to the size of its measurement increments. The smaller the measurement
increment, the more precise the tool.
•
Significant figures express the precision of a measuring tool.
•
When multiplying or dividing measured values, the final answer can contain only as many significant figures as the
value with the least number of significant figures.
•
When adding or subtracting measured values, the final answer cannot contain more decimal places than the least-
precise value.
1.7 Solving Problems in Physics
The three stages of the process for solving physics problems used in this book are as follows:
•
Strategy: Determine which physical principles are involved and develop a strategy for using them to solve the
problem.
•
Solution: Do the math necessary to obtain a numerical solution complete with units.
•
Significance: Check the solution to make sure it makes sense (correct units, reasonable magnitude and sign) and
assess its significance.

CHALLENGE PROBLEMS
88. The first atomic bomb was detonated on July 16, 1945,
at the Trinity test site about 200 mi south of Los Alamos.
In 1947, the U.S. government declassified a film reel of the
explosion. From this film reel, British physicist G. I. Taylor
Chapter 1 | Units and Measurement
41
was able to determine the rate at which the radius of the
fireball from the blast grew. Using dimensional analysis, he
was then able to deduce the amount of energy released in
the explosion, which was a closely guarded secret at the
time. Because of this, Taylor did not publish his results until
1950. This problem challenges you to recreate this famous
calculation. (a) Using keen physical insight developed from
years of experience, Taylor decided the radius r of the
fireball should depend only on time since the explosion,
t, the density of the air, ρ,
and the energy of the initial
explosion, E. Thus, he made the educated guess that
r = kEa ρb tc for some dimensionless constant k and some
unknown exponents a, b, and c. Given that [E] = ML2T–2,
determine the values of the exponents necessary to make
this equation dimensionally consistent. (Hint: Notice the
equation implies that k = rE−a ρ−b t−c and that [k] = 1.
) (b) By analyzing data from high-energy conventional
explosives, Taylor found the formula he derived seemed to
be valid as long as the constant k had the value 1.03. From
the film reel, he was able to determine many values of r
and the corresponding values of t. For example, he found
that after 25.0 ms, the fireball had a radius of 130.0 m.
Use these values, along with an average air density of 1.25
kg/m3, to calculate the initial energy release of the Trinity
detonation in joules (J). (Hint: To get energy in joules,
you need to make sure all the numbers you substitute in
are expressed in terms of SI base units.) (c) The energy
released in large explosions is often cited in units of “tons
of TNT” (abbreviated “t TNT”), where 1 t TNT is about
4.2 GJ. Convert your answer to (b) into kilotons of TNT
(that is, kt TNT). Compare your answer with the quick-
and-dirty estimate of 10 kt TNT made by physicist Enrico
Fermi shortly after witnessing the explosion from what was
thought to be a safe distance. (Reportedly, Fermi made his
estimate by dropping some shredded bits of paper right
before the remnants of the shock wave hit him and looked
to see how far they were carried by it.)
89.
The purpose of this problem is to show the entire
concept of dimensional consistency can be summarized
by the old saying “You can’t add apples and oranges.” If
you have studied power series expansions in a calculus
course, you know the standard mathematical functions such
as trigonometric functions, logarithms, and exponential
functions can be expressed as infinite sums of the form
∑
n = 0
∞
an xn = a0 + a1 x + a2 x2 + a3 x3 + ⋯,
where
the
an
are
dimensionless
constants
for
all
n = 0, 1, 2, ⋯
and x is the argument of the function.
(If you have not studied power series in calculus yet, just
trust us.) Use this fact to explain why the requirement
that all terms in an equation have the same dimensions is
sufficient as a definition of dimensional consistency. That
is,
it
actually
implies
the
arguments
of
standard
mathematical functions must be dimensionless, so it is not
really necessary to make this latter condition a separate
requirement of the definition of dimensional consistency as
we have done in this section.

Figure 2.1 A signpost gives information about distances and directions to towns or to other locations relative to the location of
the signpost. Distance is a scalar quantity. Knowing the distance alone is not enough to get to the town; we must also know the
direction from the signpost to the town. The direction, together with the distance, is a vector quantity commonly called the
displacement vector. A signpost, therefore, gives information about displacement vectors from the signpost to towns. (credit:

Introduction
Vectors are essential to physics and engineering. Many fundamental physical quantities are vectors, including displacement,
velocity, force, and electric and magnetic vector fields. Scalar products of vectors define other fundamental scalar physical
quantities, such as energy. Vector products of vectors define still other fundamental vector physical quantities, such as torque
and angular momentum. In other words, vectors are a component part of physics in much the same way as sentences are a
component part of literature.
In introductory physics, vectors are Euclidean quantities that have geometric representations as arrows in one dimension (in
a line), in two dimensions (in a plane), or in three dimensions (in space). They can be added, subtracted, or multiplied. In
this chapter, we explore elements of vector algebra for applications in mechanics and in electricity and magnetism. Vector
operations also have numerous generalizations in other branches of physics.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Describe the difference between vector and scalar quantities.
•
Identify the magnitude and direction of a vector.
•
Explain the effect of multiplying a vector quantity by a scalar.
•
Describe how one-dimensional vector quantities are added or subtracted.
•
Explain the geometric construction for the addition or subtraction of vectors in a plane.
•
Distinguish between a vector equation and a scalar equation.
Many familiar physical quantities can be specified completely by giving a single number and the appropriate unit. For
example, “a class period lasts 50 min” or “the gas tank in my car holds 65 L” or “the distance between two posts is 100
m.” A physical quantity that can be specified completely in this manner is called a scalar quantity. Scalar is a synonym of
“number.” Time, mass, distance, length, volume, temperature, and energy are examples of scalar quantities.
Scalar quantities that have the same physical units can be added or subtracted according to the usual rules of algebra for
numbers. For example, a class ending 10 min earlier than 50 min lasts 50 min −10 min = 40 min . Similarly, a 60-cal
serving of corn followed by a 200-cal serving of donuts gives 60 cal + 200 cal = 260 cal of energy. When we multiply
a scalar quantity by a number, we obtain the same scalar quantity but with a larger (or smaller) value. For example, if
yesterday’s breakfast had 200 cal of energy and today’s breakfast has four times as much energy as it had yesterday, then
today’s breakfast has 4(200 cal) = 800 cal of energy. Two scalar quantities can also be multiplied or divided by each other
to form a derived scalar quantity. For example, if a train covers a distance of 100 km in 1.0 h, its speed is 100.0 km/1.0 h =
27.8 m/s, where the speed is a derived scalar quantity obtained by dividing distance by time.
Many physical quantities, however, cannot be described completely by just a single number of physical units. For example,
when the U.S. Coast Guard dispatches a ship or a helicopter for a rescue mission, the rescue team must know not only the
distance to the distress signal, but also the direction from which the signal is coming so they can get to its origin as quickly
as possible. Physical quantities specified completely by giving a number of units (magnitude) and a direction are called
vector quantities. Examples of vector quantities include displacement, velocity, position, force, and torque. In the language
of mathematics, physical vector quantities are represented by mathematical objects called vectors (Figure 2.2). We can
add or subtract two vectors, and we can multiply a vector by a scalar or by another vector, but we cannot divide by a vector.
The operation of division by a vector is not defined.
Figure 2.2 We draw a vector from the initial point or origin
(called the “tail” of a vector) to the end or terminal point (called
the “head” of a vector), marked by an arrowhead. Magnitude is
the length of a vector and is always a positive scalar quantity.

Let’s examine vector algebra using a graphical method to be aware of basic terms and to develop a qualitative
understanding. In practice, however, when it comes to solving physics problems, we use analytical methods, which we’ll
see in the next section. Analytical methods are more simple computationally and more accurate than graphical methods.
From now on, to distinguish between a vector and a scalar quantity, we adopt the common convention that a letter in bold
44
Chapter 2 | Vectors

type with an arrow above it denotes a vector, and a letter without an arrow denotes a scalar. For example, a distance of 2.0
km, which is a scalar quantity, is denoted by d = 2.0 km, whereas a displacement of 2.0 km in some direction, which is a
vector quantity, is denoted by
d
→.
Suppose you tell a friend on a camping trip that you have discovered a terrific fishing hole 6 km from your tent. It is unlikely
your friend would be able to find the hole easily unless you also communicate the direction in which it can be found with
respect to your campsite. You may say, for example, “Walk about 6 km northeast from my tent.” The key concept here is
that you have to give not one but two pieces of information—namely, the distance or magnitude (6 km) and the direction
(northeast).
Displacement is a general term used to describe a change in position, such as during a trip from the tent to the fishing hole.
Displacement is an example of a vector quantity. If you walk from the tent (location A) to the hole (location B), as shown
in Figure 2.3, the vector
D
→, representing your displacement, is drawn as the arrow that originates at point A and ends
at point B. The arrowhead marks the end of the vector. The direction of the displacement vector
D
→is the direction of the
arrow. The length of the arrow represents the magnitude D of vector
D
→. Here, D = 6 km. Since the magnitude of a vector
is its length, which is a positive number, the magnitude is also indicated by placing the absolute value notation around the
symbol that denotes the vector; so, we can write equivalently that D ≡| D
→| . To solve a vector problem graphically, we
need to draw the vector
D
→
to scale. For example, if we assume 1 unit of distance (1 km) is represented in the drawing
by a line segment of length u = 2 cm, then the total displacement in this example is represented by a vector of length
d = 6u = 6(2 cm) = 12 cm , as shown in Figure 2.4. Notice that here, to avoid confusion, we used D = 6 km to denote
the magnitude of the actual displacement and d = 12 cm to denote the length of its representation in the drawing.
Figure 2.3 The displacement vector from point A (the initial
position at the campsite) to point B (the final position at the
fishing hole) is indicated by an arrow with origin at point A and
end at point B. The displacement is the same for any of the
actual paths (dashed curves) that may be taken between points A
and B.
Chapter 2 | Vectors
45
Figure 2.4 A displacement
D
→of magnitude 6 km is drawn
to scale as a vector of length 12 cm when the length of 2 cm
represents 1 unit of displacement (which in this case is 1 km).
Suppose your friend walks from the campsite at A to the fishing pond at B and then walks back: from the fishing pond at
B to the campsite at A. The magnitude of the displacement vector
D
→
AB from A to B is the same as the magnitude of the
displacement vector
D
→
BA from B to A (it equals 6 km in both cases), so we can write DAB = DBA . However, vector
D
→
AB is not equal to vector
D
→
BA because these two vectors have different directions:
D
→
AB ≠D
→
BA . In Figure
2.3, vector
D
→
BA would be represented by a vector with an origin at point B and an end at point A, indicating vector
D
→
BA points to the southwest, which is exactly 180° opposite to the direction of vector
D
→
AB . We say that vector
D
→
BA is antiparallel to vector
D
→
AB and write
D
→
AB = −D
→
BA , where the minus sign indicates the antiparallel
direction.
Two vectors that have identical directions are said to be parallel vectors—meaning, they are parallel to each other. Two
parallel vectors
A
→and
B
→are equal, denoted by
A
→= B
→, if and only if they have equal magnitudes | A
→| = | B
→| .
Two vectors with directions perpendicular to each other are said to be orthogonal vectors. These relations between vectors
are illustrated in Figure 2.5.

Algebra of Vectors in One Dimension
Vectors can be multiplied by scalars, added to other vectors, or subtracted from other vectors. We can illustrate these vector
concepts using an example of the fishing trip seen in Figure 2.6.
Chapter 2 | Vectors

Figure 2.6 Displacement vectors for a fishing trip. (a) Stopping to rest at point C while walking from camp (point A) to the
pond (point B). (b) Going back for the dropped tackle box (point D). (c) Finishing up at the fishing pond.
Suppose your friend departs from point A (the campsite) and walks in the direction to point B (the fishing pond), but,
along the way, stops to rest at some point C located three-quarters of the distance between A and B, beginning from
point A (Figure 2.6(a)). What is his displacement vector
D
→
AC when he reaches point C? We know that if he walks
all the way to B, his displacement vector relative to A is
D
→
AB , which has magnitude DAB = 6 km and a direction
of northeast. If he walks only a 0.75 fraction of the total distance, maintaining the northeasterly direction, at point C he
must be 0.75DAB = 4.5 km away from the campsite at A. So, his displacement vector at the rest point C has magnitude
DAC = 4.5 km = 0.75DAB and is parallel to the displacement vector
D
→
AB . All of this can be stated succinctly in the
form of the following vector equation:
D
→
AC = 0.75 D
→
AB.
In a vector equation, both sides of the equation are vectors. The previous equation is an example of a vector multiplied by a
positive scalar (number) α = 0.75 . The result,
D
→
AC , of such a multiplication is a new vector with a direction parallel to
the direction of the original vector
D
→
AB .
In general, when a vector
A
→is multiplied by a positive scalar α , the result is a new vector
B
→that is parallel to
A
→:
(2.1)
B
→= α A
→.
The magnitude | B
→| of this new vector is obtained by multiplying the magnitude | A
→| of the original vector, as expressed
by the scalar equation:
(2.2)
B = |α|A.
In a scalar equation, both sides of the equation are numbers. Equation 2.2 is a scalar equation because the magnitudes
of vectors are scalar quantities (and positive numbers). If the scalar α is negative in the vector equation Equation 2.1,
then the magnitude | B
→| of the new vector is still given by Equation 2.2, but the direction of the new vector
B
→
is
48
Chapter 2 | Vectors

antiparallel to the direction of
A
→. These principles are illustrated in Figure 2.7(a) by two examples where the length
of vector
A
→
is 1.5 units. When α = 2 , the new vector
B
→= 2 A
→
has length B = 2A = 3.0 units (twice as long
as the original vector) and is parallel to the original vector. When α = −2 , the new vector
C
→= −2 A
→
has length
C = | −2|A = 3.0 units (twice as long as the original vector) and is antiparallel to the original vector.

Now suppose your fishing buddy departs from point A (the campsite), walking in the direction to point B (the fishing
hole), but he realizes he lost his tackle box when he stopped to rest at point C (located three-quarters of the distance
between A and B, beginning from point A). So, he turns back and retraces his steps in the direction toward the campsite
and finds the box lying on the path at some point D only 1.2 km away from point C (see Figure 2.6(b)). What is his
displacement vector
D
→
AD when he finds the box at point D? What is his displacement vector
D
→
DB from point D to the
hole? We have already established that at rest point C his displacement vector is
D
→
AC = 0.75 D
→
AB . Starting at point
C, he walks southwest (toward the campsite), which means his new displacement vector
D
→
CD from point C to point
D is antiparallel to
D
→
AB . Its magnitude | D
→
CD| is DCD = 1.2 km = 0.2DAB , so his second displacement vector is
D
→
CD = −0.2 D
→
AB . His total displacement
D
→
AD relative to the campsite is the vector sum of the two displacement
vectors: vector
D
→
AC (from the campsite to the rest point) and vector
D
→
CD (from the rest point to the point where he
finds his box):
(2.3)
D
→
AD = D
→
AC + D
→
CD.
The vector sum of two (or more) vectors is called the resultant vector or, for short, the resultant. When the vectors on the
right-hand-side of Equation 2.3 are known, we can find the resultant
D
→
AD as follows:
(2.4)
D
→
AD = D
→
AC + D
→
CD = 0.75 D
→
AB −0.2 D
→
AB = (0.75 −0.2) D
→
AB = 0.55 D
→
AB.
When your friend finally reaches the pond at B, his displacement vector
D
→
AB from point A is the vector sum of his
Chapter 2 | Vectors
49
displacement vector
D
→
AD from point A to point D and his displacement vector
D
→
DB from point D to the fishing hole:
D
→
AB = D
→
AD + D
→
DB (see Figure 2.6(c)). This means his displacement vector
D
→
DB is the difference of two
vectors:
(2.5)
D
→
DB = D
→
AB −D
→
AD = D
→
AB + (−D
→
AD).
Notice that a difference of two vectors is nothing more than a vector sum of two vectors because the second term in
Equation 2.5 is vector −D
→
AD (which is antiparallel to
D
→
AD) . When we substitute Equation 2.4 into Equation
2.5, we obtain the second displacement vector:
(2.6)
D
→
DB = D
→
AB −D
→
AD = D
→
AB −0.55 D
→
AB = (1.0 −0.55) D
→
AB = 0.45 D
→
AB.
This result means your friend walked DDB = 0.45DAB = 0.45(6.0 km) = 2.7 km from the point where he finds his tackle
box to the fishing hole.
When vectors
A
→
and
B
→
lie along a line (that is, in one dimension), such as in the camping example, their resultant
R
→= A
→+ B
→and their difference
D
→= A
→−B
→both lie along the same direction. We can illustrate the addition
or subtraction of vectors by drawing the corresponding vectors to scale in one dimension, as shown in Figure 2.7.
To illustrate the resultant when
A
→and
B
→are two parallel vectors, we draw them along one line by placing the origin
of one vector at the end of the other vector in head-to-tail fashion (see Figure 2.7(b)). The magnitude of this resultant
is the sum of their magnitudes: R = A + B. The direction of the resultant is parallel to both vectors. When vector
A
→
is antiparallel to vector
B
→, we draw them along one line in either head-to-head fashion (Figure 2.7(c)) or tail-to-
tail fashion. The magnitude of the vector difference, then, is the absolute value D = |A −B| of the difference of their
magnitudes. The direction of the difference vector
D
→is parallel to the direction of the longer vector.
In general, in one dimension—as well as in higher dimensions, such as in a plane or in space—we can add any number of
vectors and we can do so in any order because the addition of vectors is commutative,
(2.7)
A
→+ B
→= B
→+ A
→,
and associative,
(2.8)
( A
→+ B
→) + C
→= A
→+ ( B
→+ C
→).
Moreover, multiplication by a scalar is distributive:
(2.9)
α1 A
→+ α2 A
→= (α1 + α2) A
→.
We used the distributive property in Equation 2.4 and Equation 2.6.
When adding many vectors in one dimension, it is convenient to use the concept of a unit vector. A unit vector, which
is denoted by a letter symbol with a hat, such as u
^ , has a magnitude of one and does not have any physical unit so that
|u
^| ≡u = 1 . The only role of a unit vector is to specify direction. For example, instead of saying vector
D
→
AB has a
50
Chapter 2 | Vectors

magnitude of 6.0 km and a direction of northeast, we can introduce a unit vector u
^ that points to the northeast and say
succinctly that
D
→
AB = (6.0 km)u
^ . Then the southwesterly direction is simply given by the unit vector −u
^ . In this way,
the displacement of 6.0 km in the southwesterly direction is expressed by the vector
D
→
BA = (−6.0 km)u
^.
Example 2.1
A Ladybug Walker
A long measuring stick rests against a wall in a physics laboratory with its 200-cm end at the floor. A ladybug
lands on the 100-cm mark and crawls randomly along the stick. It first walks 15 cm toward the floor, then it walks
56 cm toward the wall, then it walks 3 cm toward the floor again. Then, after a brief stop, it continues for 25 cm
toward the floor and then, again, it crawls up 19 cm toward the wall before coming to a complete rest (Figure
2.8). Find the vector of its total displacement and its final resting position on the stick.
Strategy
If we choose the direction along the stick toward the floor as the direction of unit vector u
^ , then the direction
toward the floor is + u
^
and the direction toward the wall is −u
^ . The ladybug makes a total of five
displacements:
D
→
1 = (15 cm)( + u
^),
D
→
2 = (56 cm)(−u
^),
D
→
3 = (3 cm)( + u
^),
D
→
4 = (25 cm)( + u
^), and
D
→
5 = (19 cm)(−u
^).
The total displacement
D
→is the resultant of all its displacement vectors.

Solution
The resultant of all the displacement vectors is
D

→
1 + D

2 + D

^)
= (15 −56 + 3 + 25 −19)cmu
^
= −32 cmu
^.
In this calculation, we use the distributive law given by Equation 2.9. The result reads that the total
displacement vector points away from the 100-cm mark (initial landing site) toward the end of the meter stick
that touches the wall. The end that touches the wall is marked 0 cm, so the final position of the ladybug is at the
(100 – 32)cm = 68-cm mark.
Check Your Understanding A cave diver enters a long underwater tunnel. When her displacement with
respect to the entry point is 20 m, she accidentally drops her camera, but she doesn’t notice it missing until she
is some 6 m farther into the tunnel. She swims back 10 m but cannot find the camera, so she decides to end the
dive. How far from the entry point is she? Taking the positive direction out of the tunnel, what is her
displacement vector relative to the entry point?
Algebra of Vectors in Two Dimensions
When vectors lie in a plane—that is, when they are in two dimensions—they can be multiplied by scalars, added to other
vectors, or subtracted from other vectors in accordance with the general laws expressed by Equation 2.1, Equation 2.2,
Equation 2.7, and Equation 2.8. However, the addition rule for two vectors in a plane becomes more complicated than
the rule for vector addition in one dimension. We have to use the laws of geometry to construct resultant vectors, followed
by trigonometry to find vector magnitudes and directions. This geometric approach is commonly used in navigation
(Figure 2.9). In this section, we need to have at hand two rulers, a triangle, a protractor, a pencil, and an eraser for drawing
vectors to scale by geometric constructions.
Figure 2.9 In navigation, the laws of geometry are used to draw resultant displacements on
nautical maps.

For a geometric construction of the sum of two vectors in a plane, we follow the parallelogram rule. Suppose two vectors
A
→and
B
→are at the arbitrary positions shown in Figure 2.10. Translate either one of them in parallel to the beginning
of the other vector, so that after the translation, both vectors have their origins at the same point. Now, at the end of vector
A
→we draw a line parallel to vector
B
→and at the end of vector
B
→we draw a line parallel to vector
A
→(the dashed
lines in Figure 2.10). In this way, we obtain a parallelogram. From the origin of the two vectors we draw a diagonal that is
the resultant
R
→of the two vectors:
R
→= A
→+ B
→(Figure 2.10(a)). The other diagonal of this parallelogram is the
vector difference of the two vectors
D
→= A
→−B
→, as shown in Figure 2.10(b). Notice that the end of the difference
vector is placed at the end of vector
A
→.
Figure 2.10 The parallelogram rule for the addition of two vectors. Make the parallel translation of each vector to a point
where their origins (marked by the dot) coincide and construct a parallelogram with two sides on the vectors and the other
two sides (indicated by dashed lines) parallel to the vectors. (a) Draw the resultant vector
R
→along the diagonal of the
parallelogram from the common point to the opposite corner. Length R of the resultant vector is not equal to the sum of the
magnitudes of the two vectors. (b) Draw the difference vector
D
→= A
→−B
→along the diagonal connecting the ends of
the vectors. Place the origin of vector
D
→at the end of vector
B
→and the end (arrowhead) of vector
D
→at the end of
vector
A
→. Length D of the difference vector is not equal to the difference of magnitudes of the two vectors.
It follows from the parallelogram rule that neither the magnitude of the resultant vector nor the magnitude of the difference
vector can be expressed as a simple sum or difference of magnitudes A and B, because the length of a diagonal cannot be
expressed as a simple sum of side lengths. When using a geometric construction to find magnitudes | R
→| and | D
→| , we
have to use trigonometry laws for triangles, which may lead to complicated algebra. There are two ways to circumvent this
algebraic complexity. One way is to use the method of components, which we examine in the next section. The other way is
to draw the vectors to scale, as is done in navigation, and read approximate vector lengths and angles (directions) from the
graphs. In this section we examine the second approach.
If we need to add three or more vectors, we repeat the parallelogram rule for the pairs of vectors until we find the resultant
of all of the resultants. For three vectors, for example, we first find the resultant of vector 1 and vector 2, and then we
find the resultant of this resultant and vector 3. The order in which we select the pairs of vectors does not matter because
the operation of vector addition is commutative and associative (see Equation 2.7 and Equation 2.8). Before we state a
general rule that follows from repetitive applications of the parallelogram rule, let’s look at the following example.
Suppose you plan a vacation trip in Florida. Departing from Tallahassee, the state capital, you plan to visit your uncle
Joe in Jacksonville, see your cousin Vinny in Daytona Beach, stop for a little fun in Orlando, see a circus performance
in Tampa, and visit the University of Florida in Gainesville. Your route may be represented by five displacement vectors
A
→,
B
→,
C
→,
D
→, and
E
→, which are indicated by the red vectors in Figure 2.11. What is your total displacement
when you reach Gainesville? The total displacement is the vector sum of all five displacement vectors, which may be
found by using the parallelogram rule four times. Alternatively, recall that the displacement vector has its beginning at
the initial position (Tallahassee) and its end at the final position (Gainesville), so the total displacement vector can be
drawn directly as an arrow connecting Tallahassee with Gainesville (see the green vector in Figure 2.11). When we use
the parallelogram rule four times, the resultant
R
→
we obtain is exactly this green vector connecting Tallahassee with
Gainesville:
R
→= A
→+ B
→+ C
→+ D
→+ E
→.

53
Figure 2.11 When we use the parallelogram rule four times, we obtain the resultant vector
R
→= A
→+ B
→+ C
→+ D
→+ E
→, which is the green vector connecting Tallahassee with Gainesville.
Drawing the resultant vector of many vectors can be generalized by using the following tail-to-head geometric
construction. Suppose we want to draw the resultant vector
R
→
of four vectors
A
→,
B
→,
C
→, and
D
→
(Figure
2.12(a)). We select any one of the vectors as the first vector and make a parallel translation of a second vector to a position
where the origin (“tail”) of the second vector coincides with the end (“head”) of the first vector. Then, we select a third
vector and make a parallel translation of the third vector to a position where the origin of the third vector coincides with
the end of the second vector. We repeat this procedure until all the vectors are in a head-to-tail arrangement like the one
shown in Figure 2.12. We draw the resultant vector
R
→by connecting the origin (“tail”) of the first vector with the end
(“head”) of the last vector. The end of the resultant vector is at the end of the last vector. Because the addition of vectors is
associative and commutative, we obtain the same resultant vector regardless of which vector we choose to be first, second,
third, or fourth in this construction.

Strategy
In geometric construction, to find a vector means to find its magnitude and its direction angle with the horizontal
direction. The strategy is to draw to scale the vectors that appear on the right-hand side of the equation and
construct the resultant vector. Then, use a ruler and a protractor to read the magnitude of the resultant and the
direction angle. For parts (a) and (b) we use the parallelogram rule. For (c) we use the tail-to-head method.
Solution
For parts (a) and (b), we attach the origin of vector
B
→to the origin of vector
A
→, as shown in Figure 2.14,
and construct a parallelogram. The shorter diagonal of this parallelogram is the sum
A

to measure the angles with the horizontal. For the resultant
R

difference
D

In vector addition, the order in which we draw the vectors is unimportant, but drawing the vectors to scale is very
important. Next, we draw vector

2.2 | Coordinate Systems and Components of a Vector
Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Describe vectors in two and three dimensions in terms of their components, using unit vectors
along the axes.
•
Distinguish between the vector components of a vector and the scalar components of a vector.
•
Explain how the magnitude of a vector is defined in terms of the components of a vector.
•
Identify the direction angle of a vector in a plane.
•
Explain the connection between polar coordinates and Cartesian coordinates in a plane.
Vectors are usually described in terms of their components in a coordinate system. Even in everyday life we naturally invoke
the concept of orthogonal projections in a rectangular coordinate system. For example, if you ask someone for directions to
a particular location, you will more likely be told to go 40 km east and 30 km north than 50 km in the direction 37° north
of east.
In a rectangular (Cartesian) xy-coordinate system in a plane, a point in a plane is described by a pair of coordinates (x, y).
In a similar fashion, a vector
A
→
in a plane is described by a pair of its vector coordinates. The x-coordinate of vector
A
→
is called its x-component and the y-coordinate of vector
A
→
is called its y-component. The vector x-component is
a vector denoted by
A
→
x . The vector y-component is a vector denoted by
A
→
y . In the Cartesian system, the x and y
vector components of a vector are the orthogonal projections of this vector onto the x- and y-axes, respectively. In this way,
following the parallelogram rule for vector addition, each vector on a Cartesian plane can be expressed as the vector sum of
its vector components:

Ax and Ay that multiply the unit vectors are the scalar components
of the vector.
It is customary to denote the positive direction on the x-axis by the unit vector i
^ and the positive direction on the y-axis
by the unit vector j
^ . Unit vectors of the axes, i
^ and j
^ , define two orthogonal directions in the plane. As shown in
Figure 2.16, the x- and y- components of a vector can now be written in terms of the unit vectors of the axes:

Ay that define the vector components in Equation 2.11 are the scalar components of vector
A

2.10 with Equation 2.11, we obtain the component form of a vector:

If we know the coordinates b(xb, yb) of the origin point of a vector (where b stands for “beginning”) and the coordinates
e(xe, ye) of the end point of a vector (where e stands for “end”), we can obtain the scalar components of a vector simply
by subtracting the origin point coordinates from the end point coordinates:

Example 2.3
Displacement of a Mouse Pointer
A mouse pointer on the display monitor of a computer at its initial position is at point (6.0 cm, 1.6 cm) with
respect to the lower left-side corner. If you move the pointer to an icon located at point (2.0 cm, 4.5 cm), what is
the displacement vector of the pointer?
Strategy
The origin of the xy-coordinate system is the lower left-side corner of the computer monitor. Therefore, the unit
vector
i
^ on the x-axis points horizontally to the right and the unit vector
j
^ on the y-axis points vertically
upward. The origin of the displacement vector is located at point b(6.0, 1.6) and the end of the displacement vector
is located at point e(2.0, 4.5). Substitute the coordinates of these points into Equation 2.13 to find the scalar
components Dx and Dy of the displacement vector
D
→. Finally, substitute the coordinates into Equation
2.12 to write the displacement vector in the vector component form.
Solution
We identify xb = 6.0 , xe = 2.0 , yb = 1.6 , and ye = 4.5 , where the physical unit is 1 cm. The scalar x- and
y-components of the displacement vector are
Dx = xe −xb = (2.0 −6.0)cm = −4.0 cm,
Dy = ye −yb = (4.5 −1.6)cm = + 2.9 cm.

This solution is shown in Figure 2.17.

the origin point at b to the end point at e.
Significance
Notice that the physical unit—here, 1 cm—can be placed either with each component immediately before the unit
vector or globally for both components, as in Equation 2.14. Often, the latter way is more convenient because
it is simpler.

The vector component form of the displacement vector Equation 2.14 tells us that the mouse pointer has been
moved on the monitor 4.0 cm to the left and 2.9 cm upward from its initial position.
Check Your Understanding A blue fly lands on a sheet of graph paper at a point located 10.0 cm to the
right of its left edge and 8.0 cm above its bottom edge and walks slowly to a point located 5.0 cm from the left
edge and 5.0 cm from the bottom edge. Choose the rectangular coordinate system with the origin at the lower
left-side corner of the paper and find the displacement vector of the fly. Illustrate your solution by graphing.
When we know the scalar components Ax and Ay of a vector
A
→, we can find its magnitude A and its direction angle
θA . The direction angle—or direction, for short—is the angle the vector forms with the positive direction on the x-axis.
The angle θA is measured in the counterclockwise direction from the +x-axis to the vector (Figure 2.18). Because the
lengths A, Ax , and Ay form a right triangle, they are related by the Pythagorean theorem:
(2.15)
A2 = Ax
2 + Ay
2
⇔A =
Ax
2 + Ay
2.
This equation works even if the scalar components of a vector are negative. The direction angle θA of a vector is defined
via the tangent function of angle θA in the triangle shown in Figure 2.18:

When the vector lies either in the first quadrant or in the fourth quadrant, where component Ax is positive (Figure 2.19),
the angle θ in Equation 2.16 is identical to the direction angle θA . For vectors in the fourth quadrant, angle θ is
negative, which means that for these vectors, direction angle θA is measured clockwise from the positive x-axis. Similarly,
for vectors in the second quadrant, angle θ is negative. When the vector lies in either the second or third quadrant, where
component Ax is negative, the direction angle is θA = θ + 180° (Figure 2.19).

Vectors in the first quadrant (I) have both scalar components positive and
vectors in the third quadrant have both scalar components negative. For
vectors in quadrants II and III, the direction angle of a vector is

Magnitude and Direction of the Displacement Vector
You move a mouse pointer on the display monitor from its initial position at point (6.0 cm, 1.6 cm) to an icon
located at point (2.0 cm, 4.5 cm). What are the magnitude and direction of the displacement vector of the pointer?
Strategy
In Example 2.3, we found the displacement vector
D
→of the mouse pointer (see Equation 2.14). We identify
its scalar components Dx = −4.0 cm and Dy = + 2.9 cm and substitute into Equation 2.15 and Equation
2.16 to find the magnitude D and direction θD , respectively.
Solution
The magnitude of vector

In many applications, the magnitudes and directions of vector quantities are known and we need to find the resultant of
many vectors. For example, imagine 400 cars moving on the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco in a strong wind. Each
car gives the bridge a different push in various directions and we would like to know how big the resultant push can possibly
be. We have already gained some experience with the geometric construction of vector sums, so we know the task of finding
the resultant by drawing the vectors and measuring their lengths and angles may become intractable pretty quickly, leading
to huge errors. Worries like this do not appear when we use analytical methods. The very first step in an analytical approach
is to find vector components when the direction and magnitude of a vector are known.
Let us return to the right triangle in Figure 2.18. The quotient of the adjacent side Ax to the hypotenuse A is the cosine
function of direction angle θA , Ax/A = cos θA , and the quotient of the opposite side Ay to the hypotenuse A is the sine
function of θA , Ay/A = sin θA . When magnitude A and direction θA are known, we can solve these relations for the
scalar components:
(2.17)
⎧
⎩
⎨Ax = A cos θA
Ay = A sin θA
.
When calculating vector components with Equation 2.17, care must be taken with the angle. The direction angle θA
of a vector is the angle measured counterclockwise from the positive direction on the x-axis to the vector. The clockwise
measurement gives a negative angle.

Example 2.5
Components of Displacement Vectors
A rescue party for a missing child follows a search dog named Trooper. Trooper wanders a lot and makes many
trial sniffs along many different paths. Trooper eventually finds the child and the story has a happy ending, but his
displacements on various legs seem to be truly convoluted. On one of the legs he walks 200.0 m southeast, then
he runs north some 300.0 m. On the third leg, he examines the scents carefully for 50.0 m in the direction 30°
west of north. On the fourth leg, Trooper goes directly south for 80.0 m, picks up a fresh scent and turns 23°
west of south for 150.0 m. Find the scalar components of Trooper’s displacement vectors and his displacement
vectors in vector component form for each leg.
Strategy
Let’s adopt a rectangular coordinate system with the positive x-axis in the direction of geographic east, with the
positive y-direction pointed to geographic north. Explicitly, the unit vector i
^ of the x-axis points east and the
unit vector j
^ of the y-axis points north. Trooper makes five legs, so there are five displacement vectors. We start
by identifying their magnitudes and direction angles, then we use Equation 2.17 to find the scalar components
of the displacements and Equation 2.12 for the displacement vectors.
Solution
On the first leg, the displacement magnitude is L1 = 200.0 m and the direction is southeast. For direction
angle θ1 we can take either 45° measured clockwise from the east direction or 45° + 270° measured
counterclockwise from the east direction. With the first choice, θ1 = −45° . With the second choice,
θ1 = + 315° . We can use either one of these two angles. The components are
L1x = L1 cos θ1 = (200.0 m) cos 315° = 141.4 m,
L1y = L1 sin θ1 = (200.0 m) sin 315° = −141.4 m.
The displacement vector of the first leg is

^) m.
On the second leg of Trooper’s wanderings, the magnitude of the displacement is L2 = 300.0 m and the
direction is north. The direction angle is θ2 = + 90° . We obtain the following results:
L2x = L2 cos θ2 = (300.0 m) cos 90° = 0.0 ,
L2y = L2 sin θ2 = (300.0 m) sin 90° = 300.0 m,
L
→
2 = L2x i
^ + L2y j
^ = (300.0 m) j
^.
On the third leg, the displacement magnitude is L3 = 50.0 m and the direction is 30° west of north. The
direction angle measured counterclockwise from the eastern direction is θ3 = 30° + 90° = + 120° . This gives
the following answers:
L3x = L3 cos θ3 = (50.0 m) cos 120° = −25.0 m,
L3y = L3 sin θ3 = (50.0 m) sin 120° = + 43.3 m,

On the fourth leg of the excursion, the displacement magnitude is L4 = 80.0 m and the direction is south. The
direction angle can be taken as either θ4 = −90° or θ4 = + 270° . We obtain
Chapter 2 | Vectors

2.6
L4x = L4 cos θ4 = (80.0 m) cos (−90°) = 0 ,

L
→
4 = L4x i

^.
On the last leg, the magnitude is L5 = 150.0 m and the angle is θ5 = −23° + 270° = + 247° (23° west of
south), which gives
L5x = L5 cos θ5 = (150.0 m) cos 247° = −58.6 m,
L5y = L5 sin θ5 = (150.0 m) sin 247° = −138.1 m,

Polar Coordinates
To describe locations of points or vectors in a plane, we need two orthogonal directions. In the Cartesian coordinate system
these directions are given by unit vectors i
^ and j
^ along the x-axis and the y-axis, respectively. The Cartesian coordinate
system is very convenient to use in describing displacements and velocities of objects and the forces acting on them.
However, it becomes cumbersome when we need to describe the rotation of objects. When describing rotation, we usually
work in the polar coordinate system.
In the polar coordinate system, the location of point P in a plane is given by two polar coordinates (Figure 2.20). The first
polar coordinate is the radial coordinate r, which is the distance of point P from the origin. The second polar coordinate is
an angle φ that the radial vector makes with some chosen direction, usually the positive x-direction. In polar coordinates,
angles are measured in radians, or rads. The radial vector is attached at the origin and points away from the origin to point
P. This radial direction is described by a unit radial vector r
^ . The second unit vector t
^ is a vector orthogonal to the
radial direction r
^ . The positive + t
^ direction indicates how the angle φ changes in the counterclockwise direction. In
this way, a point P that has coordinates (x, y) in the rectangular system can be described equivalently in the polar coordinate
system by the two polar coordinates (r, φ) . Equation 2.17 is valid for any vector, so we can use it to express the x-
and y-coordinates of vector
r
→. In this way, we obtain the connection between the polar coordinates and rectangular
coordinates of point P:

Example 2.6
Polar Coordinates
A treasure hunter finds one silver coin at a location 20.0 m away from a dry well in the direction 20° north of
east and finds one gold coin at a location 10.0 m away from the well in the direction 20° north of west. What are
the polar and rectangular coordinates of these findings with respect to the well?
Strategy
The well marks the origin of the coordinate system and east is the +x-direction. We identify radial distances from
the locations to the origin, which are rS = 20.0 m (for the silver coin) and rG = 10.0 m (for the gold coin). To
find the angular coordinates, we convert 20° to radians: 20° = π20/180 = π/9 . We use Equation 2.18 to find
the x- and y-coordinates of the coins.
Solution
The angular coordinate of the silver coin is φS = π/9 , whereas the angular coordinate of the gold coin is
φG = π −π/9 = 8π/9 . Hence, the polar coordinates of the silver coin are (rS, φS) = (20.0 m, π/9) and those
of the gold coin are (rG, φG) = (10.0 m, 8π/9) . We substitute these coordinates into Equation 2.18 to obtain
rectangular coordinates. For the gold coin, the coordinates are
⎧
⎩
⎨xG = rG cos φG = (10.0 m) cos 8π/9 = −9.4 m
yG = rG sin φG = (10.0 m) sin 8π/9 = 3.4 m
⇒(xG, yG) = (−9.4 m, 3.4 m).
For the silver coin, the coordinates are
⎧
⎩
⎨xS = rS cos φS = (20.0 m) cos π/9 = 18.9 m
yS = rS sin φS = (20.0 m) sin π/9 = 6.8 m
⇒(xS, yS) = (18.9 m, 6.8 m).
Vectors in Three Dimensions
To specify the location of a point in space, we need three coordinates (x, y, z), where coordinates x and y specify locations in
a plane, and coordinate z gives a vertical position above or below the plane. Three-dimensional space has three orthogonal

65
directions, so we need not two but three unit vectors to define a three-dimensional coordinate system. In the Cartesian
coordinate system, the first two unit vectors are the unit vector of the x-axis i
^ and the unit vector of the y-axis j
^ . The
third unit vector k
^ is the direction of the z-axis (Figure 2.21). The order in which the axes are labeled, which is the
order in which the three unit vectors appear, is important because it defines the orientation of the coordinate system. The
order x-y-z, which is equivalent to the order i
^ - j
^ - k
^ , defines the standard right-handed coordinate system (positive
orientation).
Figure 2.21 Three unit vectors define a Cartesian system in
three-dimensional space. The order in which these unit vectors

If we know the coordinates of its origin b(xb, yb, zb) and of its end e(xe, ye, ze) , its scalar components are obtained by
taking their differences: Ax and Ay are given by Equation 2.13 and the z-component is given by
(2.20)
Az = ze −zb.
Magnitude A is obtained by generalizing Equation 2.15 to three dimensions:

(or, equivalently, the beginning) of the displacement vector and its second position is the end of the displacement
vector.
Solution
We identify b(300.0 m, 200.0 m, 100.0 m) and e(1200 m, 2100 m, 250 m), and use Equation 2.13 and
Equation 2.20 to find the scalar components of the drone’s displacement vector:

⎨
Dx = xe −xb = 1200.0 m −300.0 m = 900.0 m,
Dy = ye −yb = 2100.0 m −200.0 m = 1900.0 m,
Dz = ze −zb = 250.0 m −100.0 m = 150.0 m.
We substitute these components into Equation 2.19 to find the displacement vector:

We substitute into Equation 2.21 to find the magnitude of the displacement:

Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Apply analytical methods of vector algebra to find resultant vectors and to solve vector
equations for unknown vectors.
•
Interpret physical situations in terms of vector expressions.
Vectors can be added together and multiplied by scalars. Vector addition is associative (Equation 2.8) and commutative
(Equation 2.7), and vector multiplication by a sum of scalars is distributive (Equation 2.9). Also, scalar multiplication
by a sum of vectors is distributive:
(2.22)
α( A
→+ B
→) = α A
→+ α B
→.
In this equation, α is any number (a scalar). For example, a vector antiparallel to vector
A
→= Ax i
^ + Ay j
^ + Az k
^ can
be expressed simply by multiplying
A
→by the scalar α = −1 :

Example 2.8
Direction of Motion
In a Cartesian coordinate system where
i
^ denotes geographic east,
j

^
denotes altitude above sea level, a military convoy advances its position through unknown territory with velocity
v

^)km/h . If the convoy had to retreat, in what geographic direction would it be
moving?
Solution
The velocity vector has the third component
v
→z = ( + 0.1km/h)k
^ , which says the convoy is climbing at a rate
of 100 m/h through mountainous terrain. At the same time, its velocity is 4.0 km/h to the east and 3.0 km/h to
the north, so it moves on the ground in direction tan−1(3 /4) ≈37° north of east. If the convoy had to retreat,
its new velocity vector
u
→
would have to be antiparallel to
v
→
and be in the form
u
→= −α v
→, where
α is a positive number. Thus, the velocity of the retreat would be
u
→= α(−4.0 i
^ −3.0 j
^ −0.1k
^)km/h . The
negative sign of the third component indicates the convoy would be descending. The direction angle of the retreat
velocity is tan−1(−3α/ −4α) ≈37° south of west. Therefore, the convoy would be moving on the ground in
direction 37° south of west while descending on its way back.
The generalization of the number zero to vector algebra is called the null vector, denoted by
0
→. All components of the
null vector are zero,
0
→= 0 i
^ + 0 j
^ + 0k
^ , so the null vector has no length and no direction.
Two vectors
A
→and
B
→are equal vectors if and only if their difference is the null vector:
0
→= A

→= (Ax i
^ + Ay j
^ + Az k
^) −(Bx i
^ + By j
^ + Bz k
^) = (Ax −Bx) i
^ + (Ay −By) j
^ + (Az −Bz)k
^.
This vector equation means we must have simultaneously Ax −Bx = 0 , Ay −By = 0 , and Az −Bz = 0 . Hence, we can
write
A
→= B
→if and only if the corresponding components of vectors
A
→and
B
→are equal:
(2.24)
A
→= B

⇔
⎧
⎩
⎨
Ax = Bx
Ay = By
Az = Bz

Two vectors are equal when their corresponding scalar components are equal.
Resolving vectors into their scalar components (i.e., finding their scalar components) and expressing them analytically in
vector component form (given by Equation 2.19) allows us to use vector algebra to find sums or differences of many
vectors analytically (i.e., without using graphical methods). For example, to find the resultant of two vectors
A
→and
B
→
, we simply add them component by component, as follows:
R
→= A
→+ B
→= (Ax i
^ + Ay j
^ + Az k
^) + (Bx i
^ + By j
^ + Bz k
^) = (Ax + Bx) i
^ + (Ay + By) j
^ + (Az + Bz)k
^.
In this way, using Equation 2.24, scalar components of the resultant vector
R

^ are the sums of
corresponding scalar components of vectors
A

Analytical methods for finding the resultant and, in general, for solving vector equations are very important in physics
because many physical quantities are vectors. For example, we use this method in kinematics to find resultant displacement
vectors and resultant velocity vectors, in mechanics to find resultant force vectors and the resultants of many derived vector
quantities, and in electricity and magnetism to find resultant electric or magnetic vector fields.

Strategy
First, we use Equation 2.17 to find the scalar components of each vector and then we express each vector in its

For (a) we may substitute directly into Equation 2.25 to find the scalar components of the resultant:
⎧
⎩
⎨Rx = Ax + Bx + Cx = 8.19 cm −2.39 cm + 6.93 cm = 12.73 cm
Ry = Ay + By + Cy = 5.73 cm −6.58 cm + 4.00 cm = 3.15 cm .
Therefore, the resultant vector is

For (b), we may want to write the vector difference as

⎨Dx = Ax −Bx = 8.19 cm −(−2.39 cm) = 10.58 cm
Dy = Ay −By = 5.73 cm −(−6.58 cm) = 12.31 cm.
Hence, the difference vector is

Significance
Having found the vector components, we can illustrate the vectors by graphing or we can compute magnitudes
and direction angles, as shown in Figure 2.24. Results for the magnitudes in (b) and (c) can be compared with
results for the same problems obtained with the graphical method, shown in Figure 2.14 and Figure 2.15.
Notice that the analytical method produces exact results and its accuracy is not limited by the resolution of a ruler
or a protractor, as it was with the graphical method used in Example 2.2 for finding this same resultant.

The Tug-of-War Game
Four dogs named Astro, Balto, Clifford, and Dug play a tug-of-war game with a toy (Figure 2.25). Astro pulls
on the toy in direction α = 55° south of east, Balto pulls in direction β = 60° east of north, and Clifford pulls
in direction γ = 55° west of north. Astro pulls strongly with 160.0 units of force (N), which we abbreviate as A
= 160.0 N. Balto pulls even stronger than Astro with a force of magnitude B = 200.0 N, and Clifford pulls with a
force of magnitude C = 140.0 N. When Dug pulls on the toy in such a way that his force balances out the resultant
of the other three forces, the toy does not move in any direction. With how big a force and in what direction must
Dug pull on the toy for this to happen?

2.9
Strategy
We assume that east is the direction of the positive x-axis and north is the direction of the positive y-axis. As
in Example 2.9, we have to resolve the three given forces—
A
→
(the pull from Astro),
B
→
(the pull from
Balto), and
C
→
(the pull from Clifford)—into their scalar components and then find the scalar components of
the resultant vector
R
→= A
→+ B
→+ C
→. When the pulling force
D
→from Dug balances out this resultant,
the sum of
D
→
and
R
→
must give the null vector
D
→+ R
→= 0
→. This means that
D
→= −R
→, so the
pull from Dug must be antiparallel to
R
→.
Solution
The direction angles are θA = −α = −55° , θB = 90° −β = 30° , and θC = 90° + γ = 145° , and substituting
them into Equation 2.17 gives the scalar components of the three given forces:
⎧
⎩
⎨Ax = A cos θA = (160.0 N) cos (−55°) = + 91.8 N
Ay = A sin θA = (160.0 N) sin (−55°) = −131.1 N
⎧
⎩
⎨Bx = B cos θB = (200.0 N) cos 30° = + 173.2 N
By = B sin θB = (200.0 N) sin 30° = + 100.0 N
⎧
⎩
⎨Cx = C cos θC = (140.0 N) cos 145° = −114.7 N
Cy = C sin θC = (140.0 N) sin 145° = + 80.3 N
.
Now we compute scalar components of the resultant vector
R

→:
⎧
⎩
⎨Rx = Ax + Bx + Cx = + 91.8 N + 173.2 N −114.7 N = + 150.3 N
Ry = Ay + By + Cy = −131.1 N + 100.0 N + 80.3 N = + 49.2 N

Dong pulls in the direction 18.1° south of west because both components are negative, which means the pull
vector lies in the third quadrant (Figure 2.19).
Check Your Understanding Suppose that Balto in Example 2.10 leaves the game to attend to more
important matters, but Astro, Clifford, and Dug continue playing. Astro and Clifford's pull on the toy does not
change, but Dug runs around and bites on the toy in a different place. With how big a force and in what
direction must Dug pull on the toy now to balance out the combined pulls from Clifford and Astro? Illustrate
this situation by drawing a vector diagram indicating all forces involved.

Displacement of a Skier
Starting at a ski lodge, a cross-country skier goes 5.0 km north, then 3.0 km west, and finally 4.0 km southwest
before taking a rest. Find his total displacement vector relative to the lodge when he is at the rest point. How far
and in what direction must he ski from the rest point to return directly to the lodge?

We assume a rectangular coordinate system with the origin at the ski lodge and with the unit vector i

identify their magnitudes as D1 = 5.0 km , D2 = 3.0 km , and D3 = 4.0 km . We identify their directions are
the angles θ1 = 90° , θ2 = 180° , and θ3 = 180° + 45° = 225° . We resolve each displacement vector to its
scalar components and substitute the components into Equation 2.25 to obtain the scalar components of the
resultant displacement
D

displacement is

Hence, the skier’s net displacement vector is

Therefore, to return to the lodge, he must go 6.2 km in a direction about 21° south of east.
Significance
Notice that no figure is needed to solve this problem by the analytical method. Figures are required when using a
graphical method; however, we can check if our solution makes sense by sketching it, which is a useful final step

A jogger runs up a flight of 200 identical steps to the top of a hill and then runs along the top of the hill 50.0 m

Strategy
The displacement vector
D

AB is the vector sum of the jogger’s displacement vector
D

AT along the stairs
(from point A at the bottom of the stairs to point T at the top of the stairs) and his displacement vector
D
→
TB on
the top of the hill (from point A at the top of the stairs to the fountain at point T). We must find the horizontal and
the vertical components of
D

AT . If each step has width w and height h, the horizontal component of
D

AT
must have a length of 200w and the vertical component must have a length of 200h. The actual distance the jogger
covers is the sum of the distance he runs up the stairs and the distance of 50.0 m that he runs along the top of the
hill.
Solution
In the coordinate system indicated in Figure 2.26, the jogger’s displacement vector on the top of the hill is
D
→
TB = (−50.0 m) i
^ . His net displacement vector is
D

AB = D

^ + 30.0 j
^)m.
Its scalar components are DATx = −40.0 m and DATy = 30.0 m . Therefore, we must have
200w = | −40.0|m and 200h = 30.0 m.
Hence, the step width is w = 40.0 m/200 = 0.2 m = 20 cm, and the step height is h = 30.0 m/200 = 0.15 m = 15
cm. The distance that the jogger covers along the stairs is
DAT = DATx
2
+ DATy
2
= (−40.0)2 + (30.0)2 m = 50.0 m.
Thus, the actual distance he runs is DAT + DTB = 50.0 m + 50.0 m = 100.0 m . When he makes a loop and
comes back from the fountain to his initial position at point A, the total distance he covers is twice this distance,
or 200.0 m. However, his net displacement vector is zero, because when his final position is the same as his initial
position, the scalar components of his net displacement vector are zero (Equation 2.13).
In many physical situations, we often need to know the direction of a vector. For example, we may want to know the
direction of a magnetic field vector at some point or the direction of motion of an object. We have already said direction is
given by a unit vector, which is a dimensionless entity—that is, it has no physical units associated with it. When the vector
in question lies along one of the axes in a Cartesian system of coordinates, the answer is simple, because then its unit vector
of direction is either parallel or antiparallel to the direction of the unit vector of an axis. For example, the direction of vector
d
→= −5 m i
^ is unit vector d
^ = −i
^ . The general rule of finding the unit vector V

to divide it by its magnitude V:

We see from this expression that the unit vector of direction is indeed dimensionless because the numerator and the
denominator in Equation 2.26 have the same physical unit. In this way, Equation 2.26 allows us to express the unit
vector of direction in terms of unit vectors of the axes. The following example illustrates this principle.

The unit vector of the convoy’s direction of motion is the unit vector v

Significance
Note that when using the analytical method with a calculator, it is advisable to carry out your calculations to at
least three decimal places and then round off the final answer to the required number of significant figures, which
is the way we performed calculations in this example. If you round off your partial answer too early, you risk your
final answer having a huge numerical error, and it may be far off from the exact answer or from a value measured
in an experiment.
Check Your Understanding Verify that vector v

Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Explain the difference between the scalar product and the vector product of two vectors.
•
Determine the scalar product of two vectors.
•
Determine the vector product of two vectors.
•
Describe how the products of vectors are used in physics.
A vector can be multiplied by another vector but may not be divided by another vector. There are two kinds of products
of vectors used broadly in physics and engineering. One kind of multiplication is a scalar multiplication of two vectors.
Chapter 2 | Vectors
77
Taking a scalar product of two vectors results in a number (a scalar), as its name indicates. Scalar products are used to
define work and energy relations. For example, the work that a force (a vector) performs on an object while causing its
displacement (a vector) is defined as a scalar product of the force vector with the displacement vector. A quite different kind
of multiplication is a vector multiplication of vectors. Taking a vector product of two vectors returns as a result a vector, as
its name suggests. Vector products are used to define other derived vector quantities. For example, in describing rotations,
a vector quantity called torque is defined as a vector product of an applied force (a vector) and its distance from pivot to
force (a vector). It is important to distinguish between these two kinds of vector multiplications because the scalar product
is a scalar quantity and a vector product is a vector quantity.
The Scalar Product of Two Vectors (the Dot Product)
Scalar multiplication of two vectors yields a scalar product.
Scalar Product (Dot Product)
The scalar product

→of two vectors
A
→and
B
→is a number defined by the equation
(2.27)
A
→· B
→= AB cos φ,
where φ is the angle between the vectors (shown in Figure 2.27). The scalar product is also called the dot product
because of the dot notation that indicates it.
In the definition of the dot product, the direction of angle φ does not matter, and φ can be measured from either of
the two vectors to the other because cos φ = cos (−φ) = cos (2π −φ) . The dot product is a negative number when
90° < φ ≤180° and is a positive number when 0° ≤φ < 90° . Moreover, the dot product of two parallel vectors is
A

A

scalar product of two orthogonal vectors vanishes:

From Figure 2.13, the magnitudes of vectors

are A = 10.0 and F = 20.0. Angle θ , between
them, is the difference: θ = φ −α = 110° −35° = 75° . Substituting these values into Equation 2.27 gives
the scalar product.

For example, in the rectangular coordinate system in a plane, the scalar x-component of a vector is its dot product with the

Since scalar products of two different unit vectors of axes give zero, and scalar products of unit vectors with themselves
give one (see Equation 2.29 and Equation 2.30), there are only three nonzero terms in this expression. Thus, the scalar
product simplifies to
(2.33)

We can use Equation 2.33 for the scalar product in terms of scalar components of vectors to find the angle between two

Significance
Notice that when vectors are given in terms of the unit vectors of axes, we can find the angle between them
without knowing the specifics about the geographic directions the unit vectors represent. Here, for example, the
+x-direction might be to the east and the +y-direction might be to the north. But, the angle between the forces in
the problem is the same if the +x-direction is to the west and the +y-direction is to the south.

Significance
The SI unit of work is called the joule (J) , where 1 J = 1 N · m . The unit cm · N can be written as
10−2m · N = 10−2 J , so the answer can be expressed as W3 = −0.9875 J ≈−1.0 J .

The Vector Product of Two Vectors (the Cross Product)
Vector multiplication of two vectors yields a vector product.
Vector Product (Cross Product)
The vector product of two vectors
A
→
and
B
→
is denoted by
A
→× B
→
and is often referred to as a cross
product. The vector product is a vector that has its direction perpendicular to both vectors
A
→
and
B
→. In other
words, vector
A
→× B
→is perpendicular to the plane that contains vectors
A
→and
B
→, as shown in Figure 2.29.
The magnitude of the vector product is defined as
(2.35)
| A
→× B
→| = AB sin φ,
where angle φ , between the two vectors, is measured from vector
A
→
(first vector in the product) to vector
B
→
(second vector in the product), as indicated in Figure 2.29, and is between 0° and 180° .
82
Chapter 2 | Vectors

According to Equation 2.35, the vector product vanishes for pairs of vectors that are either parallel
⎛
⎝φ = 0°
⎞
⎠or
antiparallel
⎛
⎝φ = 180°
⎞
⎠because sin 0° = sin 180° = 0 .

dimensional space. (a) The vector product

→lie on the floor,
vector
C
→points vertically upward to the ceiling. (b) The vector
product
B
→× A
→is a vector antiparallel to vector
A

On the line perpendicular to the plane that contains vectors
A
→and
B
→there are two alternative directions—either up or
down, as shown in Figure 2.29—and the direction of the vector product may be either one of them. In the standard right-
handed orientation, where the angle between vectors is measured counterclockwise from the first vector, vector
A
→× B
→
points upward, as seen in Figure 2.29(a). If we reverse the order of multiplication, so that now
B
→
comes first in the
product, then vector
B
→× A
→
must point downward, as seen in Figure 2.29(b). This means that vectors
A
→× B
→
and
B
→× A
→are antiparallel to each other and that vector multiplication is not commutative but anticommutative. The
anticommutative property means the vector product reverses the sign when the order of multiplication is reversed:

The corkscrew right-hand rule is a common mnemonic used to determine the direction of the vector product. As shown
in Figure 2.30, a corkscrew is placed in a direction perpendicular to the plane that contains vectors
A
→
and
B
→, and
its handle is turned in the direction from the first to the second vector in the product. The direction of the cross product is
given by the progression of the corkscrew.

the corkscrew. (a) Upward movement means the cross-product vector
points up. (b) Downward movement means the cross-product vector
points downward.
Example 2.18
The Torque of a Force
The mechanical advantage that a familiar tool called a wrench provides (Figure 2.31) depends on magnitude F
of the applied force, on its direction with respect to the wrench handle, and on how far from the nut this force is
applied. The distance R from the nut to the point where force vector
F
→is attached is represented by the radial
vector
R
→. The physical vector quantity that makes the nut turn is called torque (denoted by τ
→) , and it is the
vector product of the distance between the pivot to force with the force: τ
→= R
→× F
→.
To loosen a rusty nut, a 20.00-N force is applied to the wrench handle at angle φ = 40° and at a distance of 0.25
m from the nut, as shown in Figure 2.31(a). Find the magnitude and direction of the torque applied to the nut.
What would the magnitude and direction of the torque be if the force were applied at angle φ = 45° , as shown
in Figure 2.31(b)? For what value of angle φ does the torque have the largest magnitude?

Figure 2.31 A wrench provides grip and mechanical advantage in applying torque to turn a nut. (a) Turn
counterclockwise to loosen the nut. (b) Turn clockwise to tighten the nut.
Strategy
We adopt the frame of reference shown in Figure 2.31, where vectors
R
→
and
F
→
lie in the xy-plane and
the origin is at the position of the nut. The radial direction along vector
R
→
(pointing away from the origin)
is the reference direction for measuring the angle φ because
R
→
is the first vector in the vector product
τ
→= R
→× F
→. Vector
τ
→
must lie along the z-axis because this is the axis that is perpendicular to the
xy-plane, where both
R
→
and
F
→
lie. To compute the magnitude τ , we use Equation 2.35. To find the
direction of τ
→, we use the corkscrew right-hand rule (Figure 2.30).
Solution
For the situation in (a), the corkscrew rule gives the direction of
R
→× F
→in the positive direction of the z-axis.
Physically, it means the torque vector τ
→points out of the page, perpendicular to the wrench handle. We identify
F = 20.00 N and R = 0.25 m, and compute the magnitude using Equation 2.35:
τ = | R
→× F
→| = RF sin φ = (0.25 m)(20.00 N) sin 40° = 3.21 N · m.
For the situation in (b), the corkscrew rule gives the direction of
R
→× F
→
in the negative direction of
the z-axis. Physically, it means the vector
τ
→
points into the page, perpendicular to the wrench handle. The
magnitude of this torque is
τ = | R
→× F
→| = RF sin φ = (0.25 m)(20.00 N) sin 45° = 3.53 N · m.
The torque has the largest value when sin φ = 1 , which happens when φ = 90° . Physically, it means the
wrench is most effective—giving us the best mechanical advantage—when we apply the force perpendicular
to
the
wrench
handle.
For
the
situation
in
this
example,
this
best-torque
value
is
τbest = RF = (0.25 m)(20.00 N) = 5.00 N · m .

Significance
When solving mechanics problems, we often do not need to use the corkscrew rule at all, as we’ll see now in the
following equivalent solution. Notice that once we have identified that vector
R
→× F
→
lies along the z-axis,
we can write this vector in terms of the unit vector k
^ of the z-axis:
R
→× F
→= RF sin φk
^.
In this equation, the number that multiplies k
^ is the scalar z-component of the vector
R
→× F
→. In the
computation of this component, care must be taken that the angle φ is measured counterclockwise from
R
→
(first
vector)
to
F
→
(second
vector).
Following
this
principle
for
the
angles,
we
obtain
RF sin ( + 40°) = + 3.2 N · m for the situation in (a), and we obtain RF sin (−45°) = −3.5 N · m for the
situation in (b). In the latter case, the angle is negative because the graph in Figure 2.31 indicates the
angle is measured clockwise; but, the same result is obtained when this angle is measured counterclockwise
because +(360° −45°) = + 315° and sin ( + 315°) = sin (−45°) . In this way, we obtain the solution without
reference to the corkscrew rule. For the situation in (a), the solution is
R
→× F
→= + 3.2 N · mk
^ ; for the
situation in (b), the solution is
R
→× F
→= −3.5 N · mk
^ .

Similar to the dot product (Equation 2.32), the cross product has the following distributive property:
(2.37)
A
→× ( B
→+ C
→) = A
→× B
→+ A
→× C
→.
The distributive property is applied frequently when vectors are expressed in their component forms, in terms of unit vectors
of Cartesian axes.
When we apply the definition of the cross product, Equation 2.35, to unit vectors i
^ , j
^ , and k
^ that define the positive
x-, y-, and z-directions in space, we find that
(2.38)
i
^ × i
^ = j
^ × j
^ = k
^ × k
^ = 0.
All other cross products of these three unit vectors must be vectors of unit magnitudes because
i
^ ,
j
^ , and k
^ are
orthogonal. For example, for the pair i
^ and j
^ , the magnitude is |
i
^ × j
^
|
= ij sin 90° = (1)(1)(1) = 1 . The direction
of the vector product i
^ × j
^ must be orthogonal to the xy-plane, which means it must be along the z-axis. The only unit
vectors along the z-axis are −k
^ or + k
^ . By the corkscrew rule, the direction of vector i
^ × j
^ must be parallel to the
positive z-axis. Therefore, the result of the multiplication i
^ × j
^ is identical to + k
^ . We can repeat similar reasoning for
the remaining pairs of unit vectors. The results of these multiplications are

Notice that in Equation 2.39, the three unit vectors i
^ , j

^ follows k
^ and comes before j
^ , or k

j
^ and comes before i
^ , or j
^ follows i

^ . The cross product of two different unit vectors is always
a third unit vector. When two unit vectors in the cross product appear in the cyclic order, the result of such a multiplication
is the remaining unit vector, as illustrated in Figure 2.32(b). When unit vectors in the cross product appear in a different
order, the result is a unit vector that is antiparallel to the remaining unit vector (i.e., the result is with the minus sign, as
shown by the examples in Figure 2.32(c) and Figure 2.32(d). In practice, when the task is to find cross products of
vectors that are given in vector component form, this rule for the cross-multiplication of unit vectors is very useful.

When performing algebraic operations involving the cross product, be very careful about keeping the correct order of
multiplication because the cross product is anticommutative. The last two steps that we still have to do to complete our task
are, first, grouping the terms that contain a common unit vector and, second, factoring. In this way we obtain the following
very useful expression for the computation of the cross product:

Cx = Ay Bz −Az By,
Cy = Az Bx −Ax Bz,
Cz = Ax By −Ay Bx.
When finding the cross product, in practice, we can use either Equation 2.35 or Equation 2.40, depending on which one
of them seems to be less complex computationally. They both lead to the same final result. One way to make sure if the
final result is correct is to use them both.
Example 2.19
A Particle in a Magnetic Field
When moving in a magnetic field, some particles may experience a magnetic force. Without going into details—a
detailed study of magnetic phenomena comes in later chapters—let’s acknowledge that the magnetic field
B
→
is a vector, the magnetic force
F
→
is a vector, and the velocity
u
→
of the particle is a vector. The magnetic
force vector is proportional to the vector product of the velocity vector with the magnetic field vector, which we
express as
F
→= ζ u
→× B
→. In this equation, a constant ζ takes care of the consistency in physical units, so
we can omit physical units on vectors
u
→and
B
→. In this example, let’s assume the constant ζ is positive.

Strategy
First, we want to find the vector product
u
→× B
→, because then we can determine the magnetic force
using
F
→= ζ u
→× B
→. Magnitude F can be found either by using components, F = Fx
2 + Fy
2 + Fz
2 , or by
computing the magnitude | u
→× B
→| directly using Equation 2.35. In the latter approach, we would have to
find the angle between vectors
u
→and
B
→. When we have
F
→, the general method for finding the direction
angle θ involves the computation of the scalar product
F
→· B
→
and substitution into Equation 2.34. To
compute the vector product we can either use Equation 2.40 or compute the product directly, whichever way is
simpler.
Solution
The components of the velocity vector are ux = −5.0 , uy = −2.0 , and uz = 3.5 .
(a) The components of the magnetic field vector are Bx = 7.2 , By = −1.0 , and Bz = −2.4 . Substituting them
into Equation 2.41 gives the scalar components of vector
F
→= ζ u
→× B
→:
⎧
⎩
⎨
⎪
⎪
Fx = ζ(uy Bz −uz By) = ζ[(−2.0)(−2.4) −(3.5)(−1.0)] = 8.3ζ
Fy = ζ(uz Bx −ux Bz) = ζ[(3.5)(7.2) −(−5.0)(−2.4)] = 13.2ζ
Fz = ζ(ux By −uy Bx) = ζ[(−5.0)(−1.0) −(−2.0)(7.2)] = 19.4ζ
.
Thus, the magnetic force is
F
→= ζ(8.3 i
^ + 13.2 j
^ + 19.4k
^) and its magnitude is
F = Fx
2 + Fy
2 + Fz
2 = ζ (8.3)2 + (13.2)2 + (19.4)2 = 24.9ζ.
To compute angle θ , we may need to find the magnitude of the magnetic field vector,
B = Bx
2 + By
2 + Bz
2 = (7.2)2 + (−1.0)2 + (−2.4)2 = 7.6,
and the scalar product
F
→· B
→:
F
→· B
→= Fx Bx + Fy By + Fz Bz = (8.3ζ)(7.2) + (13.2ζ)(−1.0) + (19.4ζ)(−2.4) = 0.
Now, substituting into Equation 2.34 gives angle θ :
cos θ =
F
→· B
→
FB
=
0
(18.2ζ)(7.6) = 0 ⇒θ = 90°.
Hence, the magnetic force vector is perpendicular to the magnetic field vector. (We could have saved some time
if we had computed the scalar product earlier.)
(b) Because vector
B
→= 4.5k
^ has only one component, we can perform the algebra quickly and find the vector
product directly:
F
→
= ζ u
→× B
→= ζ(−5.0 i
^ −2.0 j
^ + 3.5k
^) × (4.5k
^)
= ζ[(−5.0)(4.5) i
^ × k
^ + (−2.0)(4.5) j
^ × k
^ + (3.5)(4.5)k
^ × k
^]
= ζ[−22.5(−j
^) −9.0( + i
^) + 0] = ζ(−9.0 i
^ + 22.5 j
^).
The magnitude of the magnetic force is
F = Fx
2 + Fy
2 + Fz
2 = ζ (−9.0)2 + (22.5)2 + (0.0)2 = 24.2ζ.
Chapter 2 | Vectors
89
2.16
Because the scalar product is
F
→· B
→= Fx Bx + Fy By + Fz Bz = (−9.0ζ)(0) + (22.5ζ)(0) + (0)(4.5) = 0,
the magnetic force vector
F
→is perpendicular to the magnetic field vector
B
→.
Significance
Even without actually computing the scalar product, we can predict that the magnetic force vector must always
be perpendicular to the magnetic field vector because of the way this vector is constructed. Namely, the magnetic
force vector is the vector product
F
→= ζ u
→× B
→
and, by the definition of the vector product (see Figure
2.29), vector
F
→must be perpendicular to both vectors
u
→and
B
→.

In conclusion to this section, we want to stress that “dot product” and “cross product” are entirely different mathematical
objects that have different meanings. The dot product is a scalar; the cross product is a vector. Later chapters use the
terms dot product and scalar product interchangeably. Similarly, the terms cross product and vector product are used
interchangeably.

SUMMARY
2.1 Scalars and Vectors
•
A vector quantity is any quantity that has magnitude and direction, such as displacement or velocity. Vector
quantities are represented by mathematical objects called vectors.
•
Geometrically, vectors are represented by arrows, with the end marked by an arrowhead. The length of the vector is
its magnitude, which is a positive scalar. On a plane, the direction of a vector is given by the angle the vector makes
Chapter 2 | Vectors
93
with a reference direction, often an angle with the horizontal. The direction angle of a vector is a scalar.
•
Two vectors are equal if and only if they have the same magnitudes and directions. Parallel vectors have the same
direction angles but may have different magnitudes. Antiparallel vectors have direction angles that differ by 180° .
Orthogonal vectors have direction angles that differ by 90° .
•
When a vector is multiplied by a scalar, the result is another vector of a different length than the length of the original
vector. Multiplication by a positive scalar does not change the original direction; only the magnitude is affected.
Multiplication by a negative scalar reverses the original direction. The resulting vector is antiparallel to the original
vector. Multiplication by a scalar is distributive. Vectors can be divided by nonzero scalars but cannot be divided by
vectors.
•
Two or more vectors can be added to form another vector. The vector sum is called the resultant vector. We can add
vectors to vectors or scalars to scalars, but we cannot add scalars to vectors. Vector addition is commutative and
associative.
•
To construct a resultant vector of two vectors in a plane geometrically, we use the parallelogram rule. To construct
a resultant vector of many vectors in a plane geometrically, we use the tail-to-head method.
2.2 Coordinate Systems and Components of a Vector
•
Vectors are described in terms of their components in a coordinate system. In two dimensions (in a plane), vectors
have two components. In three dimensions (in space), vectors have three components.
•
A vector component of a vector is its part in an axis direction. The vector component is the product of the unit vector
of an axis with its scalar component along this axis. A vector is the resultant of its vector components.
•
Scalar components of a vector are differences of coordinates, where coordinates of the origin are subtracted from
end point coordinates of a vector. In a rectangular system, the magnitude of a vector is the square root of the sum of
the squares of its components.
•
In a plane, the direction of a vector is given by an angle the vector has with the positive x-axis. This direction angle
is measured counterclockwise. The scalar x-component of a vector can be expressed as the product of its magnitude
with the cosine of its direction angle, and the scalar y-component can be expressed as the product of its magnitude
with the sine of its direction angle.
•
In a plane, there are two equivalent coordinate systems. The Cartesian coordinate system is defined by unit vectors
i
^ and j
^ along the x-axis and the y-axis, respectively. The polar coordinate system is defined by the radial unit
vector r
^ , which gives the direction from the origin, and a unit vector t
^ , which is perpendicular (orthogonal) to
the radial direction.
2.3 Algebra of Vectors
•
Analytical methods of vector algebra allow us to find resultants of sums or differences of vectors without having to
draw them. Analytical methods of vector addition are exact, contrary to graphical methods, which are approximate.
•
Analytical methods of vector algebra are used routinely in mechanics, electricity, and magnetism. They are
important mathematical tools of physics.
2.4 Products of Vectors
•
There are two kinds of multiplication for vectors. One kind of multiplication is the scalar product, also known as
the dot product. The other kind of multiplication is the vector product, also known as the cross product. The scalar
product of vectors is a number (scalar). The vector product of vectors is a vector.
•
Both kinds of multiplication have the distributive property, but only the scalar product has the commutative
property. The vector product has the anticommutative property, which means that when we change the order in
which two vectors are multiplied, the result acquires a minus sign.
•
The scalar product of two vectors is obtained by multiplying their magnitudes with the cosine of the angle between
them. The scalar product of orthogonal vectors vanishes; the scalar product of antiparallel vectors is negative.
•
The vector product of two vectors is a vector perpendicular to both of them. Its magnitude is obtained by multiplying
94
Chapter 2 | Vectors
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12031/1.10
their magnitudes by the sine of the angle between them. The direction of the vector product can be determined by the
corkscrew right-hand rule. The vector product of two either parallel or antiparallel vectors vanishes. The magnitude
of the vector product is largest for orthogonal vectors.
•
The scalar product of vectors is used to find angles between vectors and in the definitions of derived scalar physical
quantities such as work or energy.
•
The cross product of vectors is used in definitions of derived vector physical quantities such as torque or magnetic
force, and in describing rotations.

A scuba diver makes a slow descent into the depths
of the ocean. His vertical position with respect to a boat
on the surface changes several times. He makes the first
stop 9.0 m from the boat but has a problem with equalizing
the pressure, so he ascends 3.0 m and then continues
descending for another 12.0 m to the second stop. From
there, he ascends 4 m and then descends for 18.0 m,
ascends again for 7 m and descends again for 24.0 m,
where he makes a stop, waiting for his buddy. Assuming the

Introduction
As noted in the figure caption, the chapter-opening image is of the Whirlpool Galaxy, which we examine in the first section
of this chapter. Galaxies are as immense as atoms are small, yet the same laws of physics describe both, along with all the
rest of nature—an indication of the underlying unity in the universe. The laws of physics are surprisingly few, implying an
underlying simplicity to nature’s apparent complexity. In this text, you learn about the laws of physics. Galaxies and atoms
may seem far removed from your daily life, but as you begin to explore this broad-ranging subject, you may soon come to

realize that physics plays a much larger role in your life than you first thought, no matter your life goals or career choice.
1.1 | The Scope and Scale of Physics
Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Describe the scope of physics.
•
Calculate the order of magnitude of a quantity.
•
Compare measurable length, mass, and timescales quantitatively.
•
Describe the relationships among models, theories, and laws.
Physics is devoted to the understanding of all natural phenomena. In physics, we try to understand physical phenomena at all
scales—from the world of subatomic particles to the entire universe. Despite the breadth of the subject, the various subfields
of physics share a common core. The same basic training in physics will prepare you to work in any area of physics and the
related areas of science and engineering. In this section, we investigate the scope of physics; the scales of length, mass, and
time over which the laws of physics have been shown to be applicable; and the process by which science in general, and
physics in particular, operates.
The Scope of Physics
Take another look at the chapter-opening image. The Whirlpool Galaxy contains billions of individual stars as well as huge
clouds of gas and dust. Its companion galaxy is also visible to the right. This pair of galaxies lies a staggering billion
trillion miles (1.4 × 1021 mi) from our own galaxy (which is called the Milky Way). The stars and planets that make up
the Whirlpool Galaxy might seem to be the furthest thing from most people’s everyday lives, but the Whirlpool is a great
starting point to think about the forces that hold the universe together. The forces that cause the Whirlpool Galaxy to act as
it does are thought to be the same forces we contend with here on Earth, whether we are planning to send a rocket into space
or simply planning to raise the walls for a new home. The gravity that causes the stars of the Whirlpool Galaxy to rotate and
revolve is thought to be the same as what causes water to flow over hydroelectric dams here on Earth. When you look up
at the stars, realize the forces out there are the same as the ones here on Earth. Through a study of physics, you may gain a
greater understanding of the interconnectedness of everything we can see and know in this universe.
Think, now, about all the technological devices you use on a regular basis. Computers, smartphones, global positioning
systems (GPSs), MP3 players, and satellite radio might come to mind. Then, think about the most exciting modern
technologies you have heard about in the news, such as trains that levitate above tracks, “invisibility cloaks” that bend light
around them, and microscopic robots that fight cancer cells in our bodies. All these groundbreaking advances, commonplace
or unbelievable, rely on the principles of physics. Aside from playing a significant role in technology, professionals such
as engineers, pilots, physicians, physical therapists, electricians, and computer programmers apply physics concepts in their
daily work. For example, a pilot must understand how wind forces affect a flight path; a physical therapist must understand
how the muscles in the body experience forces as they move and bend. As you will learn in this text, the principles of
physics are propelling new, exciting technologies, and these principles are applied in a wide range of careers.
The underlying order of nature makes science in general, and physics in particular, interesting and enjoyable to study. For
example, what do a bag of chips and a car battery have in common? Both contain energy that can be converted to other
forms. The law of conservation of energy (which says that energy can change form but is never lost) ties together such
topics as food calories, batteries, heat, light, and watch springs. Understanding this law makes it easier to learn about the
various forms energy takes and how they relate to one another. Apparently unrelated topics are connected through broadly
applicable physical laws, permitting an understanding beyond just the memorization of lists of facts.
Science consists of theories and laws that are the general truths of nature, as well as the body of knowledge they encompass.
Scientists are continuously trying to expand this body of knowledge and to perfect the expression of the laws that describe
it. Physics, which comes from the Greek phúsis, meaning “nature,” is concerned with describing the interactions of
energy, matter, space, and time to uncover the fundamental mechanisms that underlie every phenomenon. This concern for
describing the basic phenomena in nature essentially defines the scope of physics.
Physics aims to understand the world around us at the most basic level. It emphasizes the use of a small number of
quantitative laws to do this, which can be useful to other fields pushing the performance boundaries of existing technologies.
Consider a smartphone (Figure 1.2). Physics describes how electricity interacts with the various circuits inside the device.
This knowledge helps engineers select the appropriate materials and circuit layout when building a smartphone. Knowledge

of the physics underlying these devices is required to shrink their size or increase their processing speed. Or, think about a
GPS. Physics describes the relationship between the speed of an object, the distance over which it travels, and the time it
takes to travel that distance. When you use a GPS in a vehicle, it relies on physics equations to determine the travel time
from one location to another.
Figure 1.2 The Apple iPhone is a common smartphone with a
GPS function. Physics describes the way that electricity flows
through the circuits of this device. Engineers use their
knowledge of physics to construct an iPhone with features that
consumers will enjoy. One specific feature of an iPhone is the
GPS function. A GPS uses physics equations to determine the
drive time between two locations on a map. (credit: Jane

Knowledge of physics is useful in everyday situations as well as in nonscientific professions. It can help you understand
how microwave ovens work, why metals should not be put into them, and why they might affect pacemakers. Physics allows
you to understand the hazards of radiation and to evaluate these hazards rationally and more easily. Physics also explains the
reason why a black car radiator helps remove heat in a car engine, and it explains why a white roof helps keep the inside of
a house cool. Similarly, the operation of a car’s ignition system as well as the transmission of electrical signals throughout
our body’s nervous system are much easier to understand when you think about them in terms of basic physics.
Physics is a key element of many important disciplines and contributes directly to others. Chemistry, for example—since
it deals with the interactions of atoms and molecules—has close ties to atomic and molecular physics. Most branches of
engineering are concerned with designing new technologies, processes, or structures within the constraints set by the laws
of physics. In architecture, physics is at the heart of structural stability and is involved in the acoustics, heating, lighting, and
cooling of buildings. Parts of geology rely heavily on physics, such as radioactive dating of rocks, earthquake analysis, and
heat transfer within Earth. Some disciplines, such as biophysics and geophysics, are hybrids of physics and other disciplines.
Physics has many applications in the biological sciences. On the microscopic level, it helps describe the properties of
cells and their environments. On the macroscopic level, it explains the heat, work, and power associated with the human
body and its various organ systems. Physics is involved in medical diagnostics, such as radiographs, magnetic resonance
imaging, and ultrasonic blood flow measurements. Medical therapy sometimes involves physics directly; for example,
cancer radiotherapy uses ionizing radiation. Physics also explains sensory phenomena, such as how musical instruments
make sound, how the eye detects color, and how lasers transmit information.
It is not necessary to study all applications of physics formally. What is most useful is knowing the basic laws of physics
and developing skills in the analytical methods for applying them. The study of physics also can improve your problem-
solving skills. Furthermore, physics retains the most basic aspects of science, so it is used by all the sciences, and the study
of physics makes other sciences easier to understand.

The Scale of Physics
From the discussion so far, it should be clear that to accomplish your goals in any of the various fields within the natural
sciences and engineering, a thorough grounding in the laws of physics is necessary. The reason for this is simply that the
laws of physics govern everything in the observable universe at all measurable scales of length, mass, and time. Now, that
is easy enough to say, but to come to grips with what it really means, we need to get a little bit quantitative. So, before
surveying the various scales that physics allows us to explore, let’s first look at the concept of “order of magnitude,” which
we use to come to terms with the vast ranges of length, mass, and time that we consider in this text (Figure 1.3).
Figure 1.3 (a) Using a scanning tunneling microscope, scientists can see the individual atoms (diameters around 10–10 m) that
compose this sheet of gold. (b) Tiny phytoplankton swim among crystals of ice in the Antarctic Sea. They range from a few
micrometers (1 μm is 10–6 m) to as much as 2 mm (1 mm is 10–3 m) in length. (c) These two colliding galaxies, known as NGC
4676A (right) and NGC 4676B (left), are nicknamed “The Mice” because of the tail of gas emanating from each one. They are
located 300 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Coma Berenices. Eventually, these two galaxies will merge into
one. (credit a: modification of work by ""Erwinrossen""/Wikimedia Commons; credit b: modification of work by Prof. Gordon T.

Order of magnitude
The order of magnitude of a number is the power of 10 that most closely approximates it. Thus, the order of magnitude
refers to the scale (or size) of a value. Each power of 10 represents a different order of magnitude. For example,
101, 102, 103,
and so forth, are all different orders of magnitude, as are 100 = 1, 10−1, 10−2,
and 10−3. To find the
order of magnitude of a number, take the base-10 logarithm of the number and round it to the nearest integer, then the order
of magnitude of the number is simply the resulting power of 10. For example, the order of magnitude of 800 is 103 because
log10 800 ≈2.903,
which rounds to 3. Similarly, the order of magnitude of 450 is 103 because log10 450 ≈2.653,
which rounds to 3 as well. Thus, we say the numbers 800 and 450 are of the same order of magnitude: 103. However, the
order of magnitude of 250 is 102 because log10 250 ≈2.397,
which rounds to 2.
An equivalent but quicker way to find the order of magnitude of a number is first to write it in scientific notation and then
check to see whether the first factor is greater than or less than
10 = 100.5 ≈3. The idea is that
10 = 100.5 is halfway
between 1 = 100 and 10 = 101 on a log base-10 scale. Thus, if the first factor is less than
10,
then we round it down
to 1 and the order of magnitude is simply whatever power of 10 is required to write the number in scientific notation. On
the other hand, if the first factor is greater than
10,
then we round it up to 10 and the order of magnitude is one power of
10 higher than the power needed to write the number in scientific notation. For example, the number 800 can be written in
scientific notation as 8 × 102. Because 8 is bigger than
10 ≈3, we say the order of magnitude of 800 is 102 + 1 = 103.
The number 450 can be written as 4.5 × 102,
so its order of magnitude is also 103 because 4.5 is greater than 3. However,
250 written in scientific notation is 2.5 × 102 and 2.5 is less than 3, so its order of magnitude is 102.
The order of magnitude of a number is designed to be a ballpark estimate for the scale (or size) of its value. It is simply a
way of rounding numbers consistently to the nearest power of 10. This makes doing rough mental math with very big and
very small numbers easier. For example, the diameter of a hydrogen atom is on the order of 10−10 m, whereas the diameter
of the Sun is on the order of 109 m, so it would take roughly 109 /10−10 = 1019 hydrogen atoms to stretch across the
10

diameter of the Sun. This is much easier to do in your head than using the more precise values of 1.06 × 10−10m for a
hydrogen atom diameter and 1.39 × 109 m for the Sun’s diameter, to find that it would take 1.31 × 1019 hydrogen atoms
to stretch across the Sun’s diameter. In addition to being easier, the rough estimate is also nearly as informative as the precise
calculation.
Known ranges of length, mass, and time
The vastness of the universe and the breadth over which physics applies are illustrated by the wide range of examples of
known lengths, masses, and times (given as orders of magnitude) in Figure 1.4. Examining this table will give you a
feeling for the range of possible topics in physics and numerical values. A good way to appreciate the vastness of the ranges
of values in Figure 1.4 is to try to answer some simple comparative questions, such as the following:
•
How many hydrogen atoms does it take to stretch across the diameter of the Sun?
(Answer: 109 m/10–10 m = 1019 hydrogen atoms)
•
How many protons are there in a bacterium?
(Answer: 10–15 kg/10–27 kg = 1012 protons)
•
How many floating-point operations can a supercomputer do in 1 day?
(Answer: 105 s/10–17 s = 1022 floating-point operations)
In studying Figure 1.4, take some time to come up with similar questions that interest you and then try answering them.
Doing this can breathe some life into almost any table of numbers.

Building Models
How did we come to know the laws governing natural phenomena? What we refer to as the laws of nature are concise
descriptions of the universe around us. They are human statements of the underlying laws or rules that all natural processes
follow. Such laws are intrinsic to the universe; humans did not create them and cannot change them. We can only discover
and understand them. Their discovery is a very human endeavor, with all the elements of mystery, imagination, struggle,
triumph, and disappointment inherent in any creative effort (Figure 1.5). The cornerstone of discovering natural laws is
observation; scientists must describe the universe as it is, not as we imagine it to be.

A model is a representation of something that is often too difficult (or impossible) to display directly. Although a model
is justified by experimental tests, it is only accurate in describing certain aspects of a physical system. An example is the
Bohr model of single-electron atoms, in which the electron is pictured as orbiting the nucleus, analogous to the way planets
orbit the Sun (Figure 1.6). We cannot observe electron orbits directly, but the mental image helps explain some of the
observations we can make, such as the emission of light from hot gases (atomic spectra). However, other observations
show that the picture in the Bohr model is not really what atoms look like. The model is “wrong,” but is still useful for
some purposes. Physicists use models for a variety of purposes. For example, models can help physicists analyze a scenario
and perform a calculation or models can be used to represent a situation in the form of a computer simulation. Ultimately,
however, the results of these calculations and simulations need to be double-checked by other means—namely, observation
and experimentation.
Figure 1.6 What is a model? The Bohr model of a single-
electron atom shows the electron orbiting the nucleus in one of
several possible circular orbits. Like all models, it captures
some, but not all, aspects of the physical system.

The word theory means something different to scientists than what is often meant when the word is used in everyday
conversation. In particular, to a scientist a theory is not the same as a “guess” or an “idea” or even a “hypothesis.” The
phrase “it’s just a theory” seems meaningless and silly to scientists because science is founded on the notion of theories. To
a scientist, a theory is a testable explanation for patterns in nature supported by scientific evidence and verified multiple
times by various groups of researchers. Some theories include models to help visualize phenomena whereas others do not.
Newton’s theory of gravity, for example, does not require a model or mental image, because we can observe the objects
directly with our own senses. The kinetic theory of gases, on the other hand, is a model in which a gas is viewed as being
composed of atoms and molecules. Atoms and molecules are too small to be observed directly with our senses—thus, we
picture them mentally to understand what the instruments tell us about the behavior of gases. Although models are meant
only to describe certain aspects of a physical system accurately, a theory should describe all aspects of any system that falls
within its domain of applicability. In particular, any experimentally testable implication of a theory should be verified. If an
experiment ever shows an implication of a theory to be false, then the theory is either thrown out or modified suitably (for
example, by limiting its domain of applicability).
A law uses concise language to describe a generalized pattern in nature supported by scientific evidence and repeated
experiments. Often, a law can be expressed in the form of a single mathematical equation. Laws and theories are similar
in that they are both scientific statements that result from a tested hypothesis and are supported by scientific evidence.
However, the designation law is usually reserved for a concise and very general statement that describes phenomena in
nature, such as the law that energy is conserved during any process, or Newton’s second law of motion, which relates force
(F), mass (m), and acceleration (a) by the simple equation F = ma. A theory, in contrast, is a less concise statement of
observed behavior. For example, the theory of evolution and the theory of relativity cannot be expressed concisely enough to
be considered laws. The biggest difference between a law and a theory is that a theory is much more complex and dynamic.
A law describes a single action whereas a theory explains an entire group of related phenomena. Less broadly applicable
statements are usually called principles (such as Pascal’s principle, which is applicable only in fluids), but the distinction
between laws and principles often is not made carefully.
The models, theories, and laws we devise sometimes imply the existence of objects or phenomena that are as yet
unobserved. These predictions are remarkable triumphs and tributes to the power of science. It is the underlying order in
the universe that enables scientists to make such spectacular predictions. However, if experimentation does not verify our
predictions, then the theory or law is wrong, no matter how elegant or convenient it is. Laws can never be known with
absolute certainty because it is impossible to perform every imaginable experiment to confirm a law for every possible
scenario. Physicists operate under the assumption that all scientific laws and theories are valid until a counterexample is
observed. If a good-quality, verifiable experiment contradicts a well-established law or theory, then the law or theory must
be modified or overthrown completely.
The study of science in general, and physics in particular, is an adventure much like the exploration of an uncharted ocean.
Discoveries are made; models, theories, and laws are formulated; and the beauty of the physical universe is made more
sublime for the insights gained.
1.2 | Units and Standards
Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Describe how SI base units are defined.
•
Describe how derived units are created from base units.
•
Express quantities given in SI units using metric prefixes.
As we saw previously, the range of objects and phenomena studied in physics is immense. From the incredibly short lifetime
of a nucleus to the age of Earth, from the tiny sizes of subnuclear particles to the vast distance to the edges of the known
universe, from the force exerted by a jumping flea to the force between Earth and the Sun, there are enough factors of 10
to challenge the imagination of even the most experienced scientist. Giving numerical values for physical quantities and
equations for physical principles allows us to understand nature much more deeply than qualitative descriptions alone. To
comprehend these vast ranges, we must also have accepted units in which to express them. We shall find that even in the
potentially mundane discussion of meters, kilograms, and seconds, a profound simplicity of nature appears: all physical
quantities can be expressed as combinations of only seven base physical quantities.
14
Chapter 1 | Units and Measurement

We define a physical quantity either by specifying how it is measured or by stating how it is calculated from other
measurements. For example, we might define distance and time by specifying methods for measuring them, such as using
a meter stick and a stopwatch. Then, we could define average speed by stating that it is calculated as the total distance
traveled divided by time of travel.
Measurements of physical quantities are expressed in terms of units, which are standardized values. For example, the length
of a race, which is a physical quantity, can be expressed in units of meters (for sprinters) or kilometers (for distance runners).
Without standardized units, it would be extremely difficult for scientists to express and compare measured values in a
meaningful way (Figure 1.7).
Figure 1.7 Distances given in unknown units are maddeningly
useless.
Two major systems of units are used in the world: SI units (for the French Système International d’Unités), also known
as the metric system, and English units (also known as the customary or imperial system). English units were historically
used in nations once ruled by the British Empire and are still widely used in the United States. English units may also be
referred to as the foot–pound–second (fps) system, as opposed to the centimeter–gram–second (cgs) system. You may also
encounter the term SAE units, named after the Society of Automotive Engineers. Products such as fasteners and automotive
tools (for example, wrenches) that are measured in inches rather than metric units are referred to as SAE fasteners or SAE
wrenches.
Virtually every other country in the world (except the United States) now uses SI units as the standard. The metric system
is also the standard system agreed on by scientists and mathematicians.
SI Units: Base and Derived Units
In any system of units, the units for some physical quantities must be defined through a measurement process. These are
called the base quantities for that system and their units are the system’s base units. All other physical quantities can
then be expressed as algebraic combinations of the base quantities. Each of these physical quantities is then known as a
derived quantity and each unit is called a derived unit. The choice of base quantities is somewhat arbitrary, as long as they
are independent of each other and all other quantities can be derived from them. Typically, the goal is to choose physical
quantities that can be measured accurately to a high precision as the base quantities. The reason for this is simple. Since the
derived units can be expressed as algebraic combinations of the base units, they can only be as accurate and precise as the
base units from which they are derived.
Based on such considerations, the International Standards Organization recommends using seven base quantities, which
form the International System of Quantities (ISQ). These are the base quantities used to define the SI base units. Table 1.1
lists these seven ISQ base quantities and the corresponding SI base units.

Table 1.1 ISQ Base Quantities and Their SI Units
You are probably already familiar with some derived quantities that can be formed from the base quantities in Table 1.1.
For example, the geometric concept of area is always calculated as the product of two lengths. Thus, area is a derived
quantity that can be expressed in terms of SI base units using square meters (m × m = m2). Similarly, volume is a derived
quantity that can be expressed in cubic meters (m3). Speed is length per time; so in terms of SI base units, we could
measure it in meters per second (m/s). Volume mass density (or just density) is mass per volume, which is expressed in
terms of SI base units such as kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m3). Angles can also be thought of as derived quantities
because they can be defined as the ratio of the arc length subtended by two radii of a circle to the radius of the circle. This
is how the radian is defined. Depending on your background and interests, you may be able to come up with other derived
quantities, such as the mass flow rate (kg/s) or volume flow rate (m3/s) of a fluid, electric charge (A · s), mass flux density
[kg/(m2 · s)], and so on. We will see many more examples throughout this text. For now, the point is that every physical
quantity can be derived from the seven base quantities in Table 1.1, and the units of every physical quantity can be derived
from the seven SI base units.
For the most part, we use SI units in this text. Non-SI units are used in a few applications in which they are in very common
use, such as the measurement of temperature in degrees Celsius (°C),
the measurement of fluid volume in liters (L), and
the measurement of energies of elementary particles in electron-volts (eV). Whenever non-SI units are discussed, they are
tied to SI units through conversions. For example, 1 L is 10−3 m3.

Units of Time, Length, and Mass: The Second, Meter, and Kilogram
The initial chapters in this textbook are concerned with mechanics, fluids, and waves. In these subjects all pertinent physical
quantities can be expressed in terms of the base units of length, mass, and time. Therefore, we now turn to a discussion of
these three base units, leaving discussion of the others until they are needed later.
The second
The SI unit for time, the second (abbreviated s), has a long history. For many years it was defined as 1/86,400 of a mean
solar day. More recently, a new standard was adopted to gain greater accuracy and to define the second in terms of a
nonvarying or constant physical phenomenon (because the solar day is getting longer as a result of the very gradual slowing
of Earth’s rotation). Cesium atoms can be made to vibrate in a very steady way, and these vibrations can be readily observed
and counted. In 1967, the second was redefined as the time required for 9,192,631,770 of these vibrations to occur (Figure
1.8). Note that this may seem like more precision than you would ever need, but it isn’t—GPSs rely on the precision of
atomic clocks to be able to give you turn-by-turn directions on the surface of Earth, far from the satellites broadcasting their
location.

than a microsecond per year. The fundamental unit of time, the
second, is based on such clocks. This image looks down from
the top of an atomic fountain nearly 30 feet tall. (credit: Steve
Jurvetson)
The meter
The SI unit for length is the meter (abbreviated m); its definition has also changed over time to become more precise. The
meter was first defined in 1791 as 1/10,000,000 of the distance from the equator to the North Pole. This measurement was
improved in 1889 by redefining the meter to be the distance between two engraved lines on a platinum–iridium bar now
kept near Paris. By 1960, it had become possible to define the meter even more accurately in terms of the wavelength of
light, so it was again redefined as 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of orange light emitted by krypton atoms. In 1983, the meter
was given its current definition (in part for greater accuracy) as the distance light travels in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a
second (Figure 1.9). This change came after knowing the speed of light to be exactly 299,792,458 m/s. The length of the
meter will change if the speed of light is someday measured with greater accuracy.
Figure 1.9 The meter is defined to be the distance light travels in 1/299,792,458 of a second in a vacuum. Distance
traveled is speed multiplied by time.
The kilogram
The SI unit for mass is the kilogram (abbreviated kg); it is defined to be the mass of a platinum–iridium cylinder
kept with the old meter standard at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures near Paris. Exact replicas of the
standard kilogram are also kept at the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), located in Gaithersburg,
Maryland, outside of Washington, DC, and at other locations around the world. Scientists at NIST are currently investigating
two complementary methods of redefining the kilogram (see Figure 1.10). The determination of all other masses can be
traced ultimately to a comparison with the standard mass.
There is currently an effort to redefine the SI unit of mass in terms of more fundamental processes by 2018. You
can explore the history of mass standards and the contenders in the quest to devise a new one at the website

Metric Prefixes
SI units are part of the metric system, which is convenient for scientific and engineering calculations because the units are
categorized by factors of 10. Table 1.2 lists the metric prefixes and symbols used to denote various factors of 10 in SI units.
For example, a centimeter is one-hundredth of a meter (in symbols, 1 cm = 10–2 m) and a kilometer is a thousand meters (1
km = 103 m). Similarly, a megagram is a million grams (1 Mg = 106 g), a nanosecond is a billionth of a second (1 ns = 10–9
s), and a terameter is a trillion meters (1 Tm = 1012 m).

Table 1.2 Metric Prefixes for Powers of 10 and Their Symbols
The only rule when using metric prefixes is that you cannot “double them up.” For example, if you have measurements in
petameters (1 Pm = 1015 m), it is not proper to talk about megagigameters, although 106 × 109 = 1015. In practice, the

only time this becomes a bit confusing is when discussing masses. As we have seen, the base SI unit of mass is the kilogram
(kg), but metric prefixes need to be applied to the gram (g), because we are not allowed to “double-up” prefixes. Thus, a
thousand kilograms (103 kg) is written as a megagram (1 Mg) since
103 kg = 103 × 103 g = 106 g = 1 Mg.
Incidentally, 103 kg is also called a metric ton, abbreviated t. This is one of the units outside the SI system considered
acceptable for use with SI units.
As we see in the next section, metric systems have the advantage that conversions of units involve only powers of 10. There
are 100 cm in 1 m, 1000 m in 1 km, and so on. In nonmetric systems, such as the English system of units, the relationships
are not as simple—there are 12 in. in 1 ft, 5280 ft in 1 mi, and so on.
Another advantage of metric systems is that the same unit can be used over extremely large ranges of values simply by
scaling it with an appropriate metric prefix. The prefix is chosen by the order of magnitude of physical quantities commonly
found in the task at hand. For example, distances in meters are suitable in construction, whereas distances in kilometers are
appropriate for air travel, and nanometers are convenient in optical design. With the metric system there is no need to invent
new units for particular applications. Instead, we rescale the units with which we are already familiar.
Example 1.1
Using Metric Prefixes
Restate the mass 1.93 × 1013 kg using a metric prefix such that the resulting numerical value is bigger than one
but less than 1000.
Strategy
Since we are not allowed to “double-up” prefixes, we first need to restate the mass in grams by replacing the
prefix symbol k with a factor of 103 (see Table 1.2). Then, we should see which two prefixes in Table 1.2 are
closest to the resulting power of 10 when the number is written in scientific notation. We use whichever of these
two prefixes gives us a number between one and 1000.
Solution
Replacing the k in kilogram with a factor of 103, we find that
1.93 × 1013 kg = 1.93 × 1013 × 103 g = 1.93 × 1016 g.
From Table 1.2, we see that 1016 is between “peta-” (1015) and “exa-” (1018). If we use the “peta-” prefix, then
we find that 1.93 × 1016 g = 1.93 × 101 Pg,
since 16 = 1 + 15. Alternatively, if we use the “exa-” prefix we
find that 1.93 × 1016 g = 1.93 × 10−2Eg,
since 16 = −2 + 18. Because the problem asks for the numerical
value between one and 1000, we use the “peta-” prefix and the answer is 19.3 Pg.
Significance
It is easy to make silly arithmetic errors when switching from one prefix to another, so it is always a good idea to
check that our final answer matches the number we started with. An easy way to do this is to put both numbers in
scientific notation and count powers of 10, including the ones hidden in prefixes. If we did not make a mistake,
the powers of 10 should match up. In this problem, we started with 1.93 × 1013 kg, so we have 13 + 3 = 16
powers of 10. Our final answer in scientific notation is 1.93 × 101 Pg, so we have 1 + 15 = 16 powers of 10. So,
everything checks out.
If this mass arose from a calculation, we would also want to check to determine whether a mass this large makes
any sense in the context of the problem. For this, Figure 1.4 might be helpful.

is bigger than one but less than 1000.

1.3 | Unit Conversion
Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Use conversion factors to express the value of a given quantity in different units.
It is often necessary to convert from one unit to another. For example, if you are reading a European cookbook, some
quantities may be expressed in units of liters and you need to convert them to cups. Or perhaps you are reading walking
directions from one location to another and you are interested in how many miles you will be walking. In this case, you may
need to convert units of feet or meters to miles.
Let’s consider a simple example of how to convert units. Suppose we want to convert 80 m to kilometers. The first thing to
do is to list the units you have and the units to which you want to convert. In this case, we have units in meters and we want
to convert to kilometers. Next, we need to determine a conversion factor relating meters to kilometers. A conversion factor
is a ratio that expresses how many of one unit are equal to another unit. For example, there are 12 in. in 1 ft, 1609 m in 1
mi, 100 cm in 1 m, 60 s in 1 min, and so on. Refer to Appendix B for a more complete list of conversion factors. In this
case, we know that there are 1000 m in 1 km. Now we can set up our unit conversion. We write the units we have and then
multiply them by the conversion factor so the units cancel out, as shown:
80 m ×
1 km
1000 m = 0.080 km.
Note that the unwanted meter unit cancels, leaving only the desired kilometer unit. You can use this method to convert
between any type of unit. Now, the conversion of 80 m to kilometers is simply the use of a metric prefix, as we saw in the
preceding section, so we can get the same answer just as easily by noting that
80 m = 8.0 × 101 m = 8.0 × 10−2km = 0.080 km,
since “kilo-” means 103 (see Table 1.2) and 1 = −2 + 3. However, using conversion factors is handy when converting
between units that are not metric or when converting between derived units, as the following examples illustrate.
Example 1.2
Converting Nonmetric Units to Metric
The distance from the university to home is 10 mi and it usually takes 20 min to drive this distance. Calculate the
average speed in meters per second (m/s). (Note: Average speed is distance traveled divided by time of travel.)
Strategy
First we calculate the average speed using the given units, then we can get the average speed into the desired
units by picking the correct conversion factors and multiplying by them. The correct conversion factors are those
that cancel the unwanted units and leave the desired units in their place. In this case, we want to convert miles to
meters, so we need to know the fact that there are 1609 m in 1 mi. We also want to convert minutes to seconds,
so we use the conversion of 60 s in 1 min.
Solution
1.
Calculate average speed. Average speed is distance traveled divided by time of travel. (Take this definition
as a given for now. Average speed and other motion concepts are covered in later chapters.) In equation
form,
Average speed = Distance
Time .
2.
Substitute the given values for distance and time:
Average speed = 10 mi
20 min = 0.50 mi
min.
3.
Convert miles per minute to meters per second by multiplying by the conversion factor that cancels miles
and leave meters, and also by the conversion factor that cancels minutes and leave seconds:

m/s = 13 m/s.
Significance
Check the answer in the following ways:
1.
Be sure the units in the unit conversion cancel correctly. If the unit conversion factor was written upside
down, the units do not cancel correctly in the equation. We see the “miles” in the numerator in 0.50
mi/min cancels the “mile” in the denominator in the first conversion factor. Also, the “min” in the
denominator in 0.50 mi/min cancels the “min” in the numerator in the second conversion factor.
2.
Check that the units of the final answer are the desired units. The problem asked us to solve for average
speed in units of meters per second and, after the cancellations, the only units left are a meter (m) in the
numerator and a second (s) in the denominator, so we have indeed obtained these units.
Check Your Understanding Light travels about 9 Pm in a year. Given that a year is about 3 × 107 s,
what is the speed of light in meters per second?
Example 1.3
Converting between Metric Units
The density of iron is 7.86 g/cm3 under standard conditions. Convert this to kg/m3.
Strategy
We need to convert grams to kilograms and cubic centimeters to cubic meters. The conversion factors we need are
1 kg = 103 g and 1 cm = 10−2m. However, we are dealing with cubic centimeters (cm3 = cm × cm × cm),
so we have to use the second conversion factor three times (that is, we need to cube it). The idea is still to multiply
by the conversion factors in such a way that they cancel the units we want to get rid of and introduce the units we
want to keep.
Solution

Significance
Remember, it’s always important to check the answer.
1.
Be sure to cancel the units in the unit conversion correctly. We see that the gram (“g”) in the numerator
in 7.86 g/cm3 cancels the “g” in the denominator in the first conversion factor. Also, the three factors of
“cm” in the denominator in 7.86 g/cm3 cancel with the three factors of “cm” in the numerator that we get
by cubing the second conversion factor.
2.
Check that the units of the final answer are the desired units. The problem asked for us to convert to
kilograms per cubic meter. After the cancellations just described, we see the only units we have left are
“kg” in the numerator and three factors of “m” in the denominator (that is, one factor of “m” cubed, or
“m3”). Therefore, the units on the final answer are correct.
Check Your Understanding We know from Figure 1.4 that the diameter of Earth is on the order of 107
m, so the order of magnitude of its surface area is 1014 m2. What is that in square kilometers (that is, km2)? (Try
doing this both by converting 107 m to km and then squaring it and then by converting 1014 m2 directly to
square kilometers. You should get the same answer both ways.)
Unit conversions may not seem very interesting, but not doing them can be costly. One famous example of this situation was

seen with the Mars Climate Orbiter. This probe was launched by NASA on December 11, 1998. On September 23, 1999,
while attempting to guide the probe into its planned orbit around Mars, NASA lost contact with it. Subsequent investigations
showed a piece of software called SM_FORCES (or “small forces”) was recording thruster performance data in the English
units of pound-seconds (lb-s). However, other pieces of software that used these values for course corrections expected them
to be recorded in the SI units of newton-seconds (N-s), as dictated in the software interface protocols. This error caused the
probe to follow a very different trajectory from what NASA thought it was following, which most likely caused the probe
either to burn up in the Martian atmosphere or to shoot out into space. This failure to pay attention to unit conversions cost
hundreds of millions of dollars, not to mention all the time invested by the scientists and engineers who worked on the
project.
Check Your Understanding Given that 1 lb (pound) is 4.45 N, were the numbers being output by
SM_FORCES too big or too small?
1.4 | Dimensional Analysis
Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Find the dimensions of a mathematical expression involving physical quantities.
•
Determine whether an equation involving physical quantities is dimensionally consistent.
The dimension of any physical quantity expresses its dependence on the base quantities as a product of symbols (or powers
of symbols) representing the base quantities. Table 1.3 lists the base quantities and the symbols used for their dimension.
For example, a measurement of length is said to have dimension L or L1, a measurement of mass has dimension M or
M1, and a measurement of time has dimension T or T1. Like units, dimensions obey the rules of algebra. Thus, area is
the product of two lengths and so has dimension L2, or length squared. Similarly, volume is the product of three lengths
and has dimension L3, or length cubed. Speed has dimension length over time, L/T or LT–1. Volumetric mass density has
dimension M/L3 or ML–3, or mass over length cubed. In general, the dimension of any physical quantity can be written as
LaMb TcId ΘeN f Jg for some powers a, b, c, d, e, f, and g. We can write the dimensions of a length in this form with
a = 1 and the remaining six powers all set equal to zero: L1 = L1 M0 T0 I0 Θ0 N0 J0. Any quantity with a dimension that
can be written so that all seven powers are zero (that is, its dimension is L0 M0 T0 I0 Θ0 N0 J0 ) is called dimensionless
(or sometimes “of dimension 1,” because anything raised to the zero power is one). Physicists often call dimensionless
quantities pure numbers.

Table 1.3 Base Quantities and Their Dimensions
Physicists often use square brackets around the symbol for a physical quantity to represent the dimensions of that quantity.
For example, if r is the radius of a cylinder and h is its height, then we write [r] = L and [h] = L to indicate the
dimensions of the radius and height are both those of length, or L. Similarly, if we use the symbol A for the surface area of
a cylinder and V for its volume, then [A] = L2 and [V] = L3. If we use the symbol m for the mass of the cylinder and ρ
22
Chapter 1 | Units and Measurement

for the density of the material from which the cylinder is made, then [m] = M and [ρ] = ML−3.
The importance of the concept of dimension arises from the fact that any mathematical equation relating physical quantities
must be dimensionally consistent, which means the equation must obey the following rules:
•
Every term in an expression must have the same dimensions; it does not make sense to add or subtract quantities of
differing dimension (think of the old saying: “You can’t add apples and oranges”). In particular, the expressions on
each side of the equality in an equation must have the same dimensions.
•
The arguments of any of the standard mathematical functions such as trigonometric functions (such as sine and
cosine), logarithms, or exponential functions that appear in the equation must be dimensionless. These functions
require pure numbers as inputs and give pure numbers as outputs.
If either of these rules is violated, an equation is not dimensionally consistent and cannot possibly be a correct statement
of physical law. This simple fact can be used to check for typos or algebra mistakes, to help remember the various laws of
physics, and even to suggest the form that new laws of physics might take. This last use of dimensions is beyond the scope
of this text, but is something you will undoubtedly learn later in your academic career.
Example 1.4
Using Dimensions to Remember an Equation
Suppose we need the formula for the area of a circle for some computation. Like many people who learned
geometry too long ago to recall with any certainty, two expressions may pop into our mind when we think of
circles: πr2 and 2πr. One expression is the circumference of a circle of radius r and the other is its area. But
which is which?
Strategy
One natural strategy is to look it up, but this could take time to find information from a reputable source. Besides,
even if we think the source is reputable, we shouldn’t trust everything we read. It is nice to have a way to double-
check just by thinking about it. Also, we might be in a situation in which we cannot look things up (such as during
a test). Thus, the strategy is to find the dimensions of both expressions by making use of the fact that dimensions
follow the rules of algebra. If either expression does not have the same dimensions as area, then it cannot possibly
be the correct equation for the area of a circle.
Solution
We know the dimension of area is L2. Now, the dimension of the expression πr2 is
[πr2] = [π] · [r]2 = 1 · L2 = L2,
since the constant π is a pure number and the radius r is a length. Therefore, πr2 has the dimension of area.
Similarly, the dimension of the expression 2πr is
[2πr] = [2] · [π] · [r] = 1 · 1 · L = L,
since the constants 2 and π are both dimensionless and the radius r is a length. We see that 2πr has the
dimension of length, which means it cannot possibly be an area.
We rule out 2πr because it is not dimensionally consistent with being an area. We see that πr2 is dimensionally
consistent with being an area, so if we have to choose between these two expressions, πr2 is the one to choose.
Significance
This may seem like kind of a silly example, but the ideas are very general. As long as we know the dimensions
of the individual physical quantities that appear in an equation, we can check to see whether the equation is
dimensionally consistent. On the other hand, knowing that true equations are dimensionally consistent, we can
match expressions from our imperfect memories to the quantities for which they might be expressions. Doing this
will not help us remember dimensionless factors that appear in the equations (for example, if you had accidentally
conflated the two expressions from the example into 2πr2,
then dimensional analysis is no help), but it does
help us remember the correct basic form of equations.

1.5
Check Your Understanding Suppose we want the formula for the volume of a sphere. The two
expressions commonly mentioned in elementary discussions of spheres are 4πr2 and 4πr3 /3. One is the
volume of a sphere of radius r and the other is its surface area. Which one is the volume?
Example 1.5
Checking Equations for Dimensional Consistency
Consider the physical quantities s,
v,
a,
and t with dimensions [s] = L,
[v] = LT −1,
[a] = LT −2,
and
[t] = T.
Determine whether each of the following equations is dimensionally consistent: (a)
s = vt + 0.5at2; (b) s = vt2 + 0.5at; and (c) v = sin(at2 /s).
Strategy
By the definition of dimensional consistency, we need to check that each term in a given equation has the same
dimensions as the other terms in that equation and that the arguments of any standard mathematical functions are
dimensionless.
Solution
a.
There are no trigonometric, logarithmic, or exponential functions to worry about in this equation, so we
need only look at the dimensions of each term appearing in the equation. There are three terms, one in the
left expression and two in the expression on the right, so we look at each in turn:
[s] = L
[vt] = [v] · [t] = LT −1 · T = LT 0 = L
[0.5at2] = [a] · [t]2 = LT −2 · T2 = LT 0 = L.
All three terms have the same dimension, so this equation is dimensionally consistent.
b.
Again, there are no trigonometric, exponential, or logarithmic functions, so we only need to look at the
dimensions of each of the three terms appearing in the equation:
[s] = L
[vt2] = [v] · [t]2 = LT −1 · T2 = LT
[at] = [a] · [t] = LT −2 · T = LT −1.
None of the three terms has the same dimension as any other, so this is about as far from being
dimensionally consistent as you can get. The technical term for an equation like this is nonsense.
c.
This equation has a trigonometric function in it, so first we should check that the argument of the sine
function is dimensionless:
⎡
⎣
at2
s
⎤
⎦= [a] · [t]2
[s]
= LT −2 · T2
L
= L
L = 1.
The argument is dimensionless. So far, so good. Now we need to check the dimensions of each of the two
terms (that is, the left expression and the right expression) in the equation:
[v] = LT −1
⎡
⎣sin⎛
⎝
at2
s
⎞
⎠
⎤
⎦= 1.
The two terms have different dimensions—meaning, the equation is not dimensionally consistent. This equation
is another example of “nonsense.”
Significance
If we are trusting people, these types of dimensional checks might seem unnecessary. But, rest assured, any
24
Chapter 1 | Units and Measurement

1.6
textbook on a quantitative subject such as physics (including this one) almost certainly contains some equations
with typos. Checking equations routinely by dimensional analysis save us the embarrassment of using an incorrect
equation. Also, checking the dimensions of an equation we obtain through algebraic manipulation is a great way
to make sure we did not make a mistake (or to spot a mistake, if we made one).
Check Your Understanding Is the equation v = at dimensionally consistent?
One further point that needs to be mentioned is the effect of the operations of calculus on dimensions. We have seen that
dimensions obey the rules of algebra, just like units, but what happens when we take the derivative of one physical quantity
with respect to another or integrate a physical quantity over another? The derivative of a function is just the slope of the line
tangent to its graph and slopes are ratios, so for physical quantities v and t, we have that the dimension of the derivative of
v with respect to t is just the ratio of the dimension of v over that of t:
⎡
⎣dv
dt
⎤
⎦= [v]
[t].
Similarly, since integrals are just sums of products, the dimension of the integral of v with respect to t is simply the
dimension of v times the dimension of t:
⎡
⎣∫vdt⎤
⎦= [v] · [t].
By the same reasoning, analogous rules hold for the units of physical quantities derived from other quantities by integration
or differentiation.
1.5 | Estimates and Fermi Calculations
Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Estimate the values of physical quantities.
On many occasions, physicists, other scientists, and engineers need to make estimates for a particular quantity. Other
terms sometimes used are guesstimates, order-of-magnitude approximations, back-of-the-envelope calculations, or Fermi
calculations. (The physicist Enrico Fermi mentioned earlier was famous for his ability to estimate various kinds of data with
surprising precision.) Will that piece of equipment fit in the back of the car or do we need to rent a truck? How long will
this download take? About how large a current will there be in this circuit when it is turned on? How many houses could
a proposed power plant actually power if it is built? Note that estimating does not mean guessing a number or a formula
at random. Rather, estimation means using prior experience and sound physical reasoning to arrive at a rough idea of a
quantity’s value. Because the process of determining a reliable approximation usually involves the identification of correct
physical principles and a good guess about the relevant variables, estimating is very useful in developing physical intuition.
Estimates also allow us perform “sanity checks” on calculations or policy proposals by helping us rule out certain scenarios
or unrealistic numbers. They allow us to challenge others (as well as ourselves) in our efforts to learn truths about the world.
Many estimates are based on formulas in which the input quantities are known only to a limited precision. As you develop
physics problem-solving skills (which are applicable to a wide variety of fields), you also will develop skills at estimating.
You develop these skills by thinking more quantitatively and by being willing to take risks. As with any skill, experience
helps. Familiarity with dimensions (see Table 1.3) and units (see Table 1.1 and Table 1.2), and the scales of base
quantities (see Figure 1.4) also helps.
To make some progress in estimating, you need to have some definite ideas about how variables may be related. The
following strategies may help you in practicing the art of estimation:
•
Get big lengths from smaller lengths. When estimating lengths, remember that anything can be a ruler. Thus,
imagine breaking a big thing into smaller things, estimate the length of one of the smaller things, and multiply to
get the length of the big thing. For example, to estimate the height of a building, first count how many floors it
has. Then, estimate how big a single floor is by imagining how many people would have to stand on each other’s
Chapter 1 | Units and Measurement
25
shoulders to reach the ceiling. Last, estimate the height of a person. The product of these three estimates is your
estimate of the height of the building. It helps to have memorized a few length scales relevant to the sorts of
problems you find yourself solving. For example, knowing some of the length scales in Figure 1.4 might come
in handy. Sometimes it also helps to do this in reverse—that is, to estimate the length of a small thing, imagine a
bunch of them making up a bigger thing. For example, to estimate the thickness of a sheet of paper, estimate the
thickness of a stack of paper and then divide by the number of pages in the stack. These same strategies of breaking
big things into smaller things or aggregating smaller things into a bigger thing can sometimes be used to estimate
other physical quantities, such as masses and times.
•
Get areas and volumes from lengths. When dealing with an area or a volume of a complex object, introduce a simple
model of the object such as a sphere or a box. Then, estimate the linear dimensions (such as the radius of the sphere
or the length, width, and height of the box) first, and use your estimates to obtain the volume or area from standard
geometric formulas. If you happen to have an estimate of an object’s area or volume, you can also do the reverse;
that is, use standard geometric formulas to get an estimate of its linear dimensions.
•
Get masses from volumes and densities. When estimating masses of objects, it can help first to estimate its volume
and then to estimate its mass from a rough estimate of its average density (recall, density has dimension mass over
length cubed, so mass is density times volume). For this, it helps to remember that the density of air is around 1 kg/
m3, the density of water is 103 kg/m3, and the densest everyday solids max out at around 104 kg/m3. Asking yourself
whether an object floats or sinks in either air or water gets you a ballpark estimate of its density. You can also do
this the other way around; if you have an estimate of an object’s mass and its density, you can use them to get an
estimate of its volume.
•
If all else fails, bound it. For physical quantities for which you do not have a lot of intuition, sometimes the best
you can do is think something like: Well, it must be bigger than this and smaller than that. For example, suppose
you need to estimate the mass of a moose. Maybe you have a lot of experience with moose and know their average
mass offhand. If so, great. But for most people, the best they can do is to think something like: It must be bigger
than a person (of order 102 kg) and less than a car (of order 103 kg). If you need a single number for a subsequent
calculation, you can take the geometric mean of the upper and lower bound—that is, you multiply them together
and then take the square root. For the moose mass example, this would be
⎛
⎝102 × 103⎞
⎠
0.5
= 102.5 = 100.5 × 102 ≈3 × 102 kg.
The tighter the bounds, the better. Also, no rules are unbreakable when it comes to estimation. If you think the value
of the quantity is likely to be closer to the upper bound than the lower bound, then you may want to bump up your
estimate from the geometric mean by an order or two of magnitude.
•
One “sig. fig.” is fine. There is no need to go beyond one significant figure when doing calculations to obtain an
estimate. In most cases, the order of magnitude is good enough. The goal is just to get in the ballpark figure, so keep
the arithmetic as simple as possible.
•
Ask yourself: Does this make any sense? Last, check to see whether your answer is reasonable. How does it compare
with the values of other quantities with the same dimensions that you already know or can look up easily? If you
get some wacky answer (for example, if you estimate the mass of the Atlantic Ocean to be bigger than the mass of
Earth, or some time span to be longer than the age of the universe), first check to see whether your units are correct.
Then, check for arithmetic errors. Then, rethink the logic you used to arrive at your answer. If everything checks
out, you may have just proved that some slick new idea is actually bogus.
Example 1.6
Mass of Earth’s Oceans
Estimate the total mass of the oceans on Earth.
Strategy
We know the density of water is about 103 kg/m3, so we start with the advice to “get masses from densities
and volumes.” Thus, we need to estimate the volume of the planet’s oceans. Using the advice to “get areas and
volumes from lengths,” we can estimate the volume of the oceans as surface area times average depth, or V = AD.
We know the diameter of Earth from Figure 1.4 and we know that most of Earth’s surface is covered in water,
so we can estimate the surface area of the oceans as being roughly equal to the surface area of the planet. By

use the formula for the surface area of a sphere of diameter d—that is, A = πd2,
to estimate the surface area of
the oceans. Now we just need to estimate the average depth of the oceans. For this, we use the advice: “If all else
fails, bound it.” We happen to know the deepest points in the ocean are around 10 km and that it is not uncommon
for the ocean to be deeper than 1 km, so we take the average depth to be around (103 × 104)0.5 ≈3 × 103 m.
Now we just need to put it all together, heeding the advice that “one ‘sig. fig.’ is fine.”
Solution
We estimate the surface area of Earth (and hence the surface area of Earth’s oceans) to be roughly
A = πd2 = π(107 m)2 ≈3 × 1014 m2.
Next, using our average depth estimate of D = 3 × 103 m, which was obtained by bounding, we estimate the
volume of Earth’s oceans to be
V = AD = (3 × 1014 m2)(3 × 103 m) = 9 × 1017 m3.
Last, we estimate the mass of the world’s oceans to be
M = ρV = (103 kg/m3)(9 × 1017 m3) = 9 × 1020 kg.
Thus, we estimate that the order of magnitude of the mass of the planet’s oceans is 1021 kg.
Significance
To verify our answer to the best of our ability, we first need to answer the question: Does this make any sense?
From Figure 1.4, we see the mass of Earth’s atmosphere is on the order of 1019 kg and the mass of Earth is on
the order of 1025 kg. It is reassuring that our estimate of 1021 kg for the mass of Earth’s oceans falls somewhere
between these two. So, yes, it does seem to make sense. It just so happens that we did a search on the Web for
“mass of oceans” and the top search results all said 1.4 × 1021 kg, which is the same order of magnitude as our
estimate. Now, rather than having to trust blindly whoever first put that number up on a website (most of the other
sites probably just copied it from them, after all), we can have a little more confidence in it.
Check Your Understanding Figure 1.4 says the mass of the atmosphere is 1019 kg. Assuming the
density of the atmosphere is 1 kg/m3, estimate the height of Earth’s atmosphere. Do you think your answer is an
underestimate or an overestimate? Explain why.
How many piano tuners are there in New York City? How many leaves are on that tree? If you are studying photosynthesis
or thinking of writing a smartphone app for piano tuners, then the answers to these questions might be of great interest to
you. Otherwise, you probably couldn’t care less what the answers are. However, these are exactly the sorts of estimation
problems that people in various tech industries have been asking potential employees to evaluate their quantitative reasoning
skills. If building physical intuition and evaluating quantitative claims do not seem like sufficient reasons for you to practice
estimation problems, how about the fact that being good at them just might land you a high-paying job?

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Determine the correct number of significant figures for the result of a computation.

Figure 1.11 shows two instruments used to measure the mass of an object. The digital scale has mostly replaced the
double-pan balance in physics labs because it gives more accurate and precise measurements. But what exactly do we
mean by accurate and precise? Aren’t they the same thing? In this section we examine in detail the process of making and
reporting a measurement.
Figure 1.11 (a) A double-pan mechanical balance is used to compare different masses. Usually an object with unknown mass
is placed in one pan and objects of known mass are placed in the other pan. When the bar that connects the two pans is
horizontal, then the masses in both pans are equal. The “known masses” are typically metal cylinders of standard mass such as 1
g, 10 g, and 100 g. (b) Many mechanical balances, such as double-pan balances, have been replaced by digital scales, which can
typically measure the mass of an object more precisely. A mechanical balance may read only the mass of an object to the nearest
tenth of a gram, but many digital scales can measure the mass of an object up to the nearest thousandth of a gram. (credit a:

Accuracy and Precision of a Measurement
Science is based on observation and experiment—that is, on measurements. Accuracy is how close a measurement is to the
accepted reference value for that measurement. For example, let’s say we want to measure the length of standard printer
paper. The packaging in which we purchased the paper states that it is 11.0 in. long. We then measure the length of the paper
three times and obtain the following measurements: 11.1 in., 11.2 in., and 10.9 in. These measurements are quite accurate
because they are very close to the reference value of 11.0 in. In contrast, if we had obtained a measurement of 12 in., our
measurement would not be very accurate. Notice that the concept of accuracy requires that an accepted reference value be
given.
The precision of measurements refers to how close the agreement is between repeated independent measurements (which
are repeated under the same conditions). Consider the example of the paper measurements. The precision of the
measurements refers to the spread of the measured values. One way to analyze the precision of the measurements is to
determine the range, or difference, between the lowest and the highest measured values. In this case, the lowest value was
10.9 in. and the highest value was 11.2 in. Thus, the measured values deviated from each other by, at most, 0.3 in. These
measurements were relatively precise because they did not vary too much in value. However, if the measured values had
been 10.9 in., 11.1 in., and 11.9 in., then the measurements would not be very precise because there would be significant
28
Chapter 1 | Units and Measurement

variation from one measurement to another. Notice that the concept of precision depends only on the actual measurements
acquired and does not depend on an accepted reference value.
The measurements in the paper example are both accurate and precise, but in some cases, measurements are accurate but
not precise, or they are precise but not accurate. Let’s consider an example of a GPS attempting to locate the position
of a restaurant in a city. Think of the restaurant location as existing at the center of a bull’s-eye target and think of each
GPS attempt to locate the restaurant as a black dot. In Figure 1.12(a), we see the GPS measurements are spread out far
apart from each other, but they are all relatively close to the actual location of the restaurant at the center of the target.
This indicates a low-precision, high-accuracy measuring system. However, in Figure 1.12(b), the GPS measurements are
concentrated quite closely to one another, but they are far away from the target location. This indicates a high-precision,
low-accuracy measuring system.
Figure 1.12 A GPS attempts to locate a restaurant at the center of the bull’s-eye. The
black dots represent each attempt to pinpoint the location of the restaurant. (a) The dots
are spread out quite far apart from one another, indicating low precision, but they are each
rather close to the actual location of the restaurant, indicating high accuracy. (b) The dots
are concentrated rather closely to one another, indicating high precision, but they are

Accuracy, Precision, Uncertainty, and Discrepancy
The precision of a measuring system is related to the uncertainty in the measurements whereas the accuracy is related
to the discrepancy from the accepted reference value. Uncertainty is a quantitative measure of how much your measured
values deviate from one another. There are many different methods of calculating uncertainty, each of which is appropriate
to different situations. Some examples include taking the range (that is, the biggest less the smallest) or finding the standard
deviation of the measurements. Discrepancy (or “measurement error”) is the difference between the measured value and a
given standard or expected value. If the measurements are not very precise, then the uncertainty of the values is high. If the
measurements are not very accurate, then the discrepancy of the values is high.
Recall our example of measuring paper length; we obtained measurements of 11.1 in., 11.2 in., and 10.9 in., and the accepted
value was 11.0 in. We might average the three measurements to say our best guess is 11.1 in.; in this case, our discrepancy
is 11.1 – 11.0 = 0.1 in., which provides a quantitative measure of accuracy. We might calculate the uncertainty in our best
guess by using the range of our measured values: 0.3 in. Then we would say the length of the paper is 11.1 in. plus or minus
0.3 in. The uncertainty in a measurement, A, is often denoted as δA (read “delta A”), so the measurement result would be
recorded as A ± δA. Returning to our paper example, the measured length of the paper could be expressed as 11.1 ± 0.3
in. Since the discrepancy of 0.1 in. is less than the uncertainty of 0.3 in., we might say the measured value agrees with the
accepted reference value to within experimental uncertainty.
Some factors that contribute to uncertainty in a measurement include the following:
•
Limitations of the measuring device
•
The skill of the person taking the measurement
•
Irregularities in the object being measured
•
Any other factors that affect the outcome (highly dependent on the situation)
In our example, such factors contributing to the uncertainty could be the smallest division on the ruler is 1/16 in., the person
using the ruler has bad eyesight, the ruler is worn down on one end, or one side of the paper is slightly longer than the other.
Chapter 1 | Units and Measurement
29
1.8
At any rate, the uncertainty in a measurement must be calculated to quantify its precision. If a reference value is known, it
makes sense to calculate the discrepancy as well to quantify its accuracy.
Percent uncertainty
Another method of expressing uncertainty is as a percent of the measured value. If a measurement A is expressed with
uncertainty δA, the percent uncertainty is defined as
Percent uncertainty = δA
A × 100%.
Example 1.7
Calculating Percent Uncertainty: A Bag of Apples
A grocery store sells 5-lb bags of apples. Let’s say we purchase four bags during the course of a month and weigh
the bags each time. We obtain the following measurements:
•
Week 1 weight: 4.8 lb
•
Week 2 weight: 5.3 lb
•
Week 3 weight: 4.9 lb
•
Week 4 weight: 5.4 lb
We then determine the average weight of the 5-lb bag of apples is 5.1 ± 0.2 lb. What is the percent uncertainty of
the bag’s weight?
Strategy
First, observe that the average value of the bag’s weight, A, is 5.1 lb. The uncertainty in this value, δA, is 0.2 lb.
We can use the following equation to determine the percent uncertainty of the weight:
(1.1)
Percent uncertainty = δA
A × 100%.
Solution
Substitute the values into the equation:
Percent uncertainty = δA
A × 100% = 0.2 lb
5.1 lb × 100% = 3.9% ≈4%.
Significance
We can conclude the average weight of a bag of apples from this store is 5.1 lb ± 4%. Notice the percent
uncertainty is dimensionless because the units of weight in δA = 0.2 lb canceled those in A = 5.1 lb when we
took the ratio.
Check Your Understanding A high school track coach has just purchased a new stopwatch. The
stopwatch manual states the stopwatch has an uncertainty of ±0.05 s. Runners on the track coach’s team
regularly clock 100-m sprints of 11.49 s to 15.01 s. At the school’s last track meet, the first-place sprinter came
in at 12.04 s and the second-place sprinter came in at 12.07 s. Will the coach’s new stopwatch be helpful in
timing the sprint team? Why or why not?
Uncertainties in calculations
Uncertainty exists in anything calculated from measured quantities. For example, the area of a floor calculated from
measurements of its length and width has an uncertainty because the length and width have uncertainties. How big is the
uncertainty in something you calculate by multiplication or division? If the measurements going into the calculation have
small uncertainties (a few percent or less), then the method of adding percents can be used for multiplication or division.
This method states the percent uncertainty in a quantity calculated by multiplication or division is the sum of the percent
30
Chapter 1 | Units and Measurement
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12031/1.10
uncertainties in the items used to make the calculation. For example, if a floor has a length of 4.00 m and a width of 3.00 m,
with uncertainties of 2% and 1%, respectively, then the area of the floor is 12.0 m2 and has an uncertainty of 3%. (Expressed
as an area, this is 0.36 m2 [ 12.0 m2 × 0.03 ], which we round to 0.4 m2 since the area of the floor is given to a tenth of a
square meter.)
Precision of Measuring Tools and Significant Figures
An important factor in the precision of measurements involves the precision of the measuring tool. In general, a precise
measuring tool is one that can measure values in very small increments. For example, a standard ruler can measure length to
the nearest millimeter whereas a caliper can measure length to the nearest 0.01 mm. The caliper is a more precise measuring
tool because it can measure extremely small differences in length. The more precise the measuring tool, the more precise
the measurements.
When we express measured values, we can only list as many digits as we measured initially with our measuring tool. For
example, if we use a standard ruler to measure the length of a stick, we may measure it to be 36.7 cm. We can’t express this
value as 36.71 cm because our measuring tool is not precise enough to measure a hundredth of a centimeter. It should be
noted that the last digit in a measured value has been estimated in some way by the person performing the measurement. For
example, the person measuring the length of a stick with a ruler notices the stick length seems to be somewhere in between
36.6 cm and 36.7 cm, and he or she must estimate the value of the last digit. Using the method of significant figures, the
rule is that the last digit written down in a measurement is the first digit with some uncertainty. To determine the number
of significant digits in a value, start with the first measured value at the left and count the number of digits through the last
digit written on the right. For example, the measured value 36.7 cm has three digits, or three significant figures. Significant
figures indicate the precision of the measuring tool used to measure a value.
Zeros
Special consideration is given to zeros when counting significant figures. The zeros in 0.053 are not significant because
they are placeholders that locate the decimal point. There are two significant figures in 0.053. The zeros in 10.053 are
not placeholders; they are significant. This number has five significant figures. The zeros in 1300 may or may not be
significant, depending on the style of writing numbers. They could mean the number is known to the last digit or they
could be placeholders. So 1300 could have two, three, or four significant figures. To avoid this ambiguity, we should write
1300 in scientific notation as 1.3 × 103,
1.30 × 103,
or 1.300 × 103,
depending on whether it has two, three, or four
significant figures. Zeros are significant except when they serve only as placeholders.
Significant figures in calculations
When combining measurements with different degrees of precision, the number of significant digits in the final answer can
be no greater than the number of significant digits in the least-precise measured value. There are two different rules, one
for multiplication and division and the other for addition and subtraction.
1.
For multiplication and division, the result should have the same number of significant figures as the quantity
with the least number of significant figures entering into the calculation. For example, the area of a circle can be
calculated from its radius using A = πr2. Let’s see how many significant figures the area has if the radius has only
two—say, r = 1.2 m. Using a calculator with an eight-digit output, we would calculate
A = πr2 = (3.1415927…) × (1.2 m)2 = 4.5238934 m2.
But because the radius has only two significant figures, it limits the calculated quantity to two significant figures, or
A = 4.5 m2,
although π is good to at least eight digits.
2.
For addition and subtraction, the answer can contain no more decimal places than the least-precise measurement.
Suppose we buy 7.56 kg of potatoes in a grocery store as measured with a scale with precision 0.01 kg, then we drop
off 6.052 kg of potatoes at your laboratory as measured by a scale with precision 0.001 kg. Then, we go home and
add 13.7 kg of potatoes as measured by a bathroom scale with precision 0.1 kg. How many kilograms of potatoes do
we now have and how many significant figures are appropriate in the answer? The mass is found by simple addition
and subtraction:
Chapter 1 | Units and Measurement
31
7.56 kg
−6.052 kg
+13.7 kg
15.208 kg = 15.2 kg.
Next, we identify the least-precise measurement: 13.7 kg. This measurement is expressed to the 0.1 decimal place,
so our final answer must also be expressed to the 0.1 decimal place. Thus, the answer is rounded to the tenths place,
giving us 15.2 kg.
Significant figures in this text
In this text, most numbers are assumed to have three significant figures. Furthermore, consistent numbers of significant
figures are used in all worked examples. An answer given to three digits is based on input good to at least three digits,
for example. If the input has fewer significant figures, the answer will also have fewer significant figures. Care is also
taken that the number of significant figures is reasonable for the situation posed. In some topics, particularly in optics, more
accurate numbers are needed and we use more than three significant figures. Finally, if a number is exact, such as the two
in the formula for the circumference of a circle, C = 2πr, it does not affect the number of significant figures in a calculation.
Likewise, conversion factors such as 100 cm/1 m are considered exact and do not affect the number of significant figures in
a calculation.

to apply broad physical principles—usually represented by equations—to specific situations is a very powerful form of
knowledge. It is much more powerful than memorizing a list of facts. Analytical skills and problem-solving abilities can be
applied to new situations whereas a list of facts cannot be made long enough to contain every possible circumstance. Such
analytical skills are useful both for solving problems in this text and for applying physics in everyday life.
As you are probably well aware, a certain amount of creativity and insight is required to solve problems. No rigid procedure
works every time. Creativity and insight grow with experience. With practice, the basics of problem solving become almost
automatic. One way to get practice is to work out the text’s examples for yourself as you read. Another is to work as
many end-of-section problems as possible, starting with the easiest to build confidence and then progressing to the more
difficult. After you become involved in physics, you will see it all around you, and you can begin to apply it to situations
you encounter outside the classroom, just as is done in many of the applications in this text.
Although there is no simple step-by-step method that works for every problem, the following three-stage process facilitates
problem solving and makes it more meaningful. The three stages are strategy, solution, and significance. This process is
used in examples throughout the book. Here, we look at each stage of the process in turn.
Strategy
Strategy is the beginning stage of solving a problem. The idea is to figure out exactly what the problem is and then develop
a strategy for solving it. Some general advice for this stage is as follows:
•
Examine the situation to determine which physical principles are involved. It often helps to draw a simple sketch
at the outset. You often need to decide which direction is positive and note that on your sketch. When you have
identified the physical principles, it is much easier to find and apply the equations representing those principles.
Although finding the correct equation is essential, keep in mind that equations represent physical principles, laws of
nature, and relationships among physical quantities. Without a conceptual understanding of a problem, a numerical
solution is meaningless.
•
Make a list of what is given or can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the “knowns”). Many problems
are stated very succinctly and require some inspection to determine what is known. Drawing a sketch can be very
useful at this point as well. Formally identifying the knowns is of particular importance in applying physics to real-
world situations. For example, the word stopped means the velocity is zero at that instant. Also, we can often take
initial time and position as zero by the appropriate choice of coordinate system.
•
Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknowns). In complex problems,
especially, it is not always obvious what needs to be found or in what sequence. Making a list can help identify the
unknowns.
•
Determine which physical principles can help you solve the problem. Since physical principles tend to be expressed
in the form of mathematical equations, a list of knowns and unknowns can help here. It is easiest if you can find
equations that contain only one unknown—that is, all the other variables are known—so you can solve for the
unknown easily. If the equation contains more than one unknown, then additional equations are needed to solve the
problem. In some problems, several unknowns must be determined to get at the one needed most. In such problems
it is especially important to keep physical principles in mind to avoid going astray in a sea of equations. You may
have to use two (or more) different equations to get the final answer.
Solution
The solution stage is when you do the math. Substitute the knowns (along with their units) into the appropriate equation
and obtain numerical solutions complete with units. That is, do the algebra, calculus, geometry, or arithmetic necessary to
find the unknown from the knowns, being sure to carry the units through the calculations. This step is clearly important
because it produces the numerical answer, along with its units. Notice, however, that this stage is only one-third of the
overall problem-solving process.
Significance
After having done the math in the solution stage of problem solving, it is tempting to think you are done. But, always
remember that physics is not math. Rather, in doing physics, we use mathematics as a tool to help us understand nature. So,
after you obtain a numerical answer, you should always assess its significance:
•
Check your units. If the units of the answer are incorrect, then an error has been made and you should go back over
your previous steps to find it. One way to find the mistake is to check all the equations you derived for dimensional
consistency. However, be warned that correct units do not guarantee the numerical part of the answer is also correct.
Chapter 1 | Units and Measurement
33
•
Check the answer to see whether it is reasonable. Does it make sense? This step is extremely important: –the goal
of physics is to describe nature accurately. To determine whether the answer is reasonable, check both its magnitude
and its sign, in addition to its units. The magnitude should be consistent with a rough estimate of what it should
be. It should also compare reasonably with magnitudes of other quantities of the same type. The sign usually tells
you about direction and should be consistent with your prior expectations. Your judgment will improve as you solve
more physics problems, and it will become possible for you to make finer judgments regarding whether nature is
described adequately by the answer to a problem. This step brings the problem back to its conceptual meaning. If
you can judge whether the answer is reasonable, you have a deeper understanding of physics than just being able to
solve a problem mechanically.
•
Check to see whether the answer tells you something interesting. What does it mean? This is the flip side of the
question: Does it make sense? Ultimately, physics is about understanding nature, and we solve physics problems to
learn a little something about how nature operates. Therefore, assuming the answer does make sense, you should
always take a moment to see if it tells you something about the world that you find interesting. Even if the answer to
this particular problem is not very interesting to you, what about the method you used to solve it? Could the method
be adapted to answer a question that you do find interesting? In many ways, it is in answering questions such as
these that science progresses.

SUMMARY
1.1 The Scope and Scale of Physics
•
Physics is about trying to find the simple laws that describe all natural phenomena.
•
Physics operates on a vast range of scales of length, mass, and time. Scientists use the concept of the order of
magnitude of a number to track which phenomena occur on which scales. They also use orders of magnitude to
compare the various scales.
•
Scientists attempt to describe the world by formulating models, theories, and laws.
1.2 Units and Standards
•
Systems of units are built up from a small number of base units, which are defined by accurate and precise
measurements of conventionally chosen base quantities. Other units are then derived as algebraic combinations of
the base units.
•
Two commonly used systems of units are English units and SI units. All scientists and most of the other people in
the world use SI, whereas nonscientists in the United States still tend to use English units.
•
The SI base units of length, mass, and time are the meter (m), kilogram (kg), and second (s), respectively.
•
SI units are a metric system of units, meaning values can be calculated by factors of 10. Metric prefixes may be
used with metric units to scale the base units to sizes appropriate for almost any application.
1.3 Unit Conversion
•
To convert a quantity from one unit to another, multiply by conversions factors in such a way that you cancel the
units you want to get rid of and introduce the units you want to end up with.
•
Be careful with areas and volumes. Units obey the rules of algebra so, for example, if a unit is squared we need two
factors to cancel it.
1.4 Dimensional Analysis
•
The dimension of a physical quantity is just an expression of the base quantities from which it is derived.
•
All equations expressing physical laws or principles must be dimensionally consistent. This fact can be used as an
aid in remembering physical laws, as a way to check whether claimed relationships between physical quantities are
possible, and even to derive new physical laws.
1.5 Estimates and Fermi Calculations
•
An estimate is a rough educated guess at the value of a physical quantity based on prior experience and sound
physical reasoning. Some strategies that may help when making an estimate are as follows:
◦
Get big lengths from smaller lengths.
◦
Get areas and volumes from lengths.
◦
Get masses from volumes and densities.
◦
If all else fails, bound it.

Accuracy of a measured value refers to how close a measurement is to an accepted reference value. The discrepancy
in a measurement is the amount by which the measurement result differs from this value.

Precision of measured values refers to how close the agreement is between repeated measurements. The uncertainty
of a measurement is a quantification of this.
•
The precision of a measuring tool is related to the size of its measurement increments. The smaller the measurement
increment, the more precise the tool.
•
Significant figures express the precision of a measuring tool.
•
When multiplying or dividing measured values, the final answer can contain only as many significant figures as the
value with the least number of significant figures.
•
When adding or subtracting measured values, the final answer cannot contain more decimal places than the least-
precise value.
1.7 Solving Problems in Physics
The three stages of the process for solving physics problems used in this book are as follows:
•
Strategy: Determine which physical principles are involved and develop a strategy for using them to solve the
problem.
•
Solution: Do the math necessary to obtain a numerical solution complete with units.
•
Significance: Check the solution to make sure it makes sense (correct units, reasonable magnitude and sign) and
assess its significance.

CHALLENGE PROBLEMS
88. The first atomic bomb was detonated on July 16, 1945,
at the Trinity test site about 200 mi south of Los Alamos.
In 1947, the U.S. government declassified a film reel of the
explosion. From this film reel, British physicist G. I. Taylor
Chapter 1 | Units and Measurement
41
was able to determine the rate at which the radius of the
fireball from the blast grew. Using dimensional analysis, he
was then able to deduce the amount of energy released in
the explosion, which was a closely guarded secret at the
time. Because of this, Taylor did not publish his results until
1950. This problem challenges you to recreate this famous
calculation. (a) Using keen physical insight developed from
years of experience, Taylor decided the radius r of the
fireball should depend only on time since the explosion,
t, the density of the air, ρ,
and the energy of the initial
explosion, E. Thus, he made the educated guess that
r = kEa ρb tc for some dimensionless constant k and some
unknown exponents a, b, and c. Given that [E] = ML2T–2,
determine the values of the exponents necessary to make
this equation dimensionally consistent. (Hint: Notice the
equation implies that k = rE−a ρ−b t−c and that [k] = 1.
) (b) By analyzing data from high-energy conventional
explosives, Taylor found the formula he derived seemed to
be valid as long as the constant k had the value 1.03. From
the film reel, he was able to determine many values of r
and the corresponding values of t. For example, he found
that after 25.0 ms, the fireball had a radius of 130.0 m.
Use these values, along with an average air density of 1.25
kg/m3, to calculate the initial energy release of the Trinity
detonation in joules (J). (Hint: To get energy in joules,
you need to make sure all the numbers you substitute in
are expressed in terms of SI base units.) (c) The energy
released in large explosions is often cited in units of “tons
of TNT” (abbreviated “t TNT”), where 1 t TNT is about
4.2 GJ. Convert your answer to (b) into kilotons of TNT
(that is, kt TNT). Compare your answer with the quick-
and-dirty estimate of 10 kt TNT made by physicist Enrico
Fermi shortly after witnessing the explosion from what was
thought to be a safe distance. (Reportedly, Fermi made his
estimate by dropping some shredded bits of paper right
before the remnants of the shock wave hit him and looked
to see how far they were carried by it.)
89.
The purpose of this problem is to show the entire
concept of dimensional consistency can be summarized
by the old saying “You can’t add apples and oranges.” If
you have studied power series expansions in a calculus
course, you know the standard mathematical functions such
as trigonometric functions, logarithms, and exponential
functions can be expressed as infinite sums of the form
∑
n = 0
∞
an xn = a0 + a1 x + a2 x2 + a3 x3 + ⋯,
where
the
an
are
dimensionless
constants
for
all
n = 0, 1, 2, ⋯
and x is the argument of the function.
(If you have not studied power series in calculus yet, just
trust us.) Use this fact to explain why the requirement
that all terms in an equation have the same dimensions is
sufficient as a definition of dimensional consistency. That
is,
it
actually
implies
the
arguments
of
standard
mathematical functions must be dimensionless, so it is not
really necessary to make this latter condition a separate
requirement of the definition of dimensional consistency as
we have done in this section.
